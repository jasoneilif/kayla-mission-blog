Sister Jensen's Testimony of the Book of Mormon  
October 10th, 2022

I love the Book of Mormon so much! It has blessed my life in countless ways! In fact, while I was trying to think about how I could possibly convey how I feel about the Book of Mormon, I felt overwhelmed by the task because the Book of Mormon means so much to me and I wanted to share about it in a way that really does the book justice. After rewriting my thoughts at least 5 times, I was discouraged, so I turned to the very book I am talking about, the Book of Mormon, praying earnestly in my heart for some encouragement and direction. I flipped at random to 2 Nephi Chapter 3 on page 61. This is some of what I read:

"And out of weakness, he shall be made strong" (verse 13) It then went on to talk about Moses how he was not good at speaking, but the Lord would provide a spokesman for him. (verses 17-20) I had a thought come that even though I may not be good at speaking or rather writing, the Lord will make the spirit my spokesman and help you understand how important this is to me. I know the Book of Mormon is true. It is a book of scripture written by ancient prophets in the Americas and it testifies of Christ. It has helped me come closer to Christ than any other book and has brought back simple truths that were lost that mean so much to me. The Book of Mormon has helped me get through some of the hardest times in my life. I know that this book is true because I have felt the Spirit of the Lord testify to me that it is true through thoughts in my mind and feelings of peace, hope, and love in my heart as I studied its words and prayed about it.

If you havenâ€™t read the Book of Mormon yet, I would highly recommend it! I know it can bless your life! If you aren't sure if it is true, then study its words and pray to Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ with a sincere desire to know, and I know He will answer your prayer! Heavenly Father loves you so much and wants to speak to you! He gave us this book as well as the Bible out of love because He wants all of us to be able to have the joy and countless blessings He has in store for us.
