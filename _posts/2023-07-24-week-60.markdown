Hello everyone!

This week has been a roller coaster ride once again! 

On Tuesday, I was super tired and kept on falling asleep on our giant beanbag. Sadly this district council happened to be the one Sister Harding decided to join on. I was super out of it at the beginning. I realized a little way into the meeting that I might be dehydrated since I had just cried a lot of happy tears from having so many spiritual experiences and I hadn’t had much water in the last few days, so I went to the drinking fountains and got some water. Luckily after drinking some water, I felt a lot better. Sister Harding surprised us and decided to go out flowing with us on Main street. We flowed on Main Street by the college campus, and met four different people that we taught on the spot and an extra five who wanted to come to church! First, we found a very sweet lady named Kezia. She was on the phone with her boyfriend, but she stopped to talk with us and said she would love to come to church just not this week since it was her birthday. Then we found Dynamite. Yes, his real name is Dynamite. He said he wouldn't be able to make it on Sunday at first, but he was super interested in the Book of Mormon. We have called him twice this week and talked about it. Actually, we called him once and then he reached out first to call us on Saturday. He is a super awesome guy and very open to understanding the gospel. He's read through a lot of 3 Nephi already from the beginning of the Savior's ministry among the people to the end. He was just so cool. He is super excited to have a church tour this week with us! We also met a man named Amid who was very interested in talking to us about the Plan of Salvation, because it was different then other Christian faiths that he'd heard. He was so into our discussion that when we asked if there was another time we could talk, he asked for us to wait by his classroom at the campus when he came back from getting food. So we had a full lesson on the Plan of Salvation. It was a bit difficult at times, because he's a physics professor and had a lot of questions, but we were able to teach him and the spirit was present as we extended the invitation to read the Book of Mormon. He sadly didn’t come to church because of work, but he might come in the future! Then on our way back, as we invited people to church on the way back, we ended up meeting Carson, this random guy who didn’t want to come to church, but who prayed for us! It was such a tender miracle for us as we really needed that! Once we got to the car, we got in and were about to head to interviews with President Harding which had also snuck up on us, but Sister Oliver had an impression to knock on a man's car window in the parking lot right before we left. This was outside both of our comfort zones, but we knew we needed to do it. It turns out it was a really nice guy named Oscar! He is a really cool guy who speaks fluent French and is a chemical engineer. His beliefs about God really aligned with ours and we were able to find common ground and invite him to come and see. He said he's busy a lot of weekends but that he would very much like to try to come. He wasn’t able to make it to church, but it was so cool! We also met so many more people like Orette, Layvonne, Arnold, and Milton. It was like the Lord was raining down miracles from heaven like in the Mario game where you have a basket and you are trying to collect all the fruit as it falls from the sky. Anyways, after talking to Oscar, we hurried to interviews and those turned out good! We were able to talk to President Harding about the things we needed to. After interviews, we went home for dinner and we then we had a lesson over zoom with Jachin, a member of the Young Single Adult Branch. It went really good! Then, we spent the rest of the night organizing the information and schedule on the Preach My Gospel app.

On Wednesday, we got to serve at this nearby park which was really fun! We dug trenches and we used a rake to shovel loads and loads of mulch into wheelbarrows. It was hard work and I got two blisters on my hands. It was super fun though! After service and getting ready for the day, we had a really good lesson with Dynamite and then we went to Peabo’s for a lesson with him. It was super funny because a random dog came up and was barking at us, but Peabo told it to go away so it did! After our lesson with Peabo, we went to the Tracy’s for dinner and we had some really good Korean food! We had bulgogi and it was super good! We also had a super cool conversation and were able to connect Lord of the Ring characters with the gospel.

On Thursday, I was super dead inside. If you’ve ever played Wii Sports or something to a similar effect you’ll know that it can make your arm super sore. I felt just like that except all over my body instead of just my arm. It was not fun! I felt so exhasted that I couldn't move too much without being in pain and all I could do was sleep. I tried super hard to brush it off since we had exchanges planned for that day, but it didn’t get better by the time we had to leave. We decided to cancel exchanges since I wasn’t in a position to go anywhere. The sister training leaders ended up calling Sister Harding and they proceeded to check what we did every 15 minutes for the last 3 days and it was kind of stressful. I was able to get some needed rest and some ibuprofen which helped a lot, but it was super hard trying to figure out things with the sister training leaders. They also had us come over for exchanges that night which was not what I felt like doing since I was still super out of it and in pain, but we went anyways.

The next morning on Friday I felt a lot better and after taking a shower, I felt pretty much back to normal other than the minor aches and pains that I normally have when I exercise. Sister Allen made some ham and egg biscuit sandwiches which were really good! We also tried vegetarian chicken nuggets which were surprisingly really good–especially with Chick-Fil-A sauce. I got to be companions with Sister Moore for the day and that was really fun! We were able to meet this really cool lady named Angela who had been talking on the phone outside earlier. We hadn’t invited her to church since she had seemed busy and we were about to move on, but I felt like we needed to invite her to church so we went back after she had finished talking on the phone and we were able to share about the Book of Mormon with her and she loved it! She was so excited to hear that there was people living anciently in the Americas and accepted a copy of the Book of Mormon like it was a precious gift. It was so cool! After meeting Angela, we went to this really cute ice cream place and I got some really good mint ice cream! After that, we went to the mall to invite people to church and it went really well. We also had dinner there and I got some really good pizza! Then we went back and then went back home. It was super funny because I was in a cow joke mood and on the way back home, I made a story about a king cow to some epic music.

On Saturday, it was amazing! We ended up going to the temple with our friend Peabo since it was his first time going. It was so special! He was able to perform some baptisms! It was hard for Peabo to read the words so Tim went in the water with him and helped guide him through the process and it was so special! He was also baptized in behalf of some who had passed away and it was crazy because he was so tall that he had to kneel in the water so he could be immersed! It was so needed to be back at the temple especially after such a crazy week. It was also crazy because Sister Bolaños was there from Cherry Hill, New Jersey and she was baptized for her mom and her grandma and it was such a touching experience to see that since we had been trying to help her and her husband get to the temple. She came out crying happy tears and I gave her a big, wet hug. It was so cool! After the temple, we went to the Lenzis for dinner. Their kids were all over the place, but we had a fun time and the food was really good! They made lemon bars that were so good! Brother Lenzi had served in the mission that covered where I was from, so it was really cool talking with him! Later that day, we also had a lesson with Dynamite that was so great!

On Sunday, church was so good! We had a lot of really great talks and a really pretty musical number. We also had an amazing lesson from Emma in the young single adult congregation and it was so good! She read from the book Punchinello and it was such a needed reminder that the only thing that matters is what Heavenly Father thinks of me–not what other people think of me. It was exactly what I needed that day especially after a stressful week! After church and all of our meetings, Elin from the Bayview congregation came with some delicious homemade cookies and we had a really fun time talking with her! She is preparing to go on a mission soon! After talking with Elin, we went to the Campbell’s for dinner. We accidentally went to the wrong Campbell’s, but it turned out ok and we were still able to make it for dinner. They were so sweet and dinner was super good! After dinner, we went back home and had an amazing lesson with Dynamite! It was such a powerful lesson and the spirit was definitely there!

Anyways, that was the gist of my week! I hope you all had a great week and that this week is super fun!
