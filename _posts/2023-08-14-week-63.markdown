Hello everyone!

This week was a huge learning experience for me! There were more miracles than just with finding.

On Monday, after having a fun day with the other missionaries in our district, we had some different calls with a few of our friends that went well! It was a tornado warning though so we did the calls in the closet haha.

On Tuesday, we had district council which went really well! After that, we had lunch and I had another counseling session which went really well! I learned a lot of really cool things! After that, we went out to invite people to church and stop by Konah. It was cool because even though we didn’t have the opportunity to see Konah, we were able to meet James who lived there and teach him a little bit! It was really cool! Later that evening, we also had a lesson with Peabo and then we went to a nearby neighborhood! It was super cool because we were able to meet Lexi, Emily, and Jerry! Jerry was super cool and talked to us for a while on his doorstep! Sadly, we got a bunch of mosquito bites, but it was worth it! It was crazy that night because while we were trying to update our information, the sister training leaders came for exchanges.

On Wednesday, Sister Oliver and I went and pulled weeds for service while Sister Allen and Sister Moore went to the car place to get it serviced. After that, we all went to Canes for lunch. It was the first time I had ever had Canes. It was pretty good! After that, we split off and went out inviting people to church! I went with Sister Allen and we went to stop by some members of our congregation. We decided to knock on the doors on the way back to the car. At one of these doors, we ended up meeting Bala. He answered from the second floor window and called down and said he was on a work call, but unlike most people who say that, he accepted the invitation to come to church and gave us his number so we could call him later and explain more. He was super cool! We ended up calling him later and had a lesson with him. He already had a Book of Mormon that missionaries in Massachusetts had given him a long time ago. He loved reading the Book of Mormon, but had lost contact with the missionaries after he moved. Anyways, after meeting Bala, we went to Cold Stone and got some ice cream. It was so good! After that, we went to a nearby neighborhood and the first person we talked to at the first house told us not to knock that street because no one was interested, but said the people on the other street might be interested. We decided to take that advice and went to the other street and started knocking. We hadn’t even knocked three houses when we saw a man sitting in his car reading. We went up and invited him to church and he said he would come! Apparently, he had friends in Texas who were members, and he had even considered going to BYU, but he didn’t like the idea of shaving his beard. He also had watched BYU TV and saw a documentary about Joseph Smith. It was so cool seeing how all of these things prepared him to hear about the message of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. After that, we decided to knock in one last area I had been eyeing earlier that day and we ended up meeting this really nice lady named Linda! After that, we headed to the Moser’s house for dinner and I had tapioca pudding for the first time and it was really good!

On Thursday, we had a crazy day! We planned out our week and then we had lunch and then a lesson with our friend Kenneth over the phone. Brother Leifheit joined on the lesson and it was awesome! It was kind of long though so we were kind of tired afterwards. It was raining really hard, but we decided to go out in the rain anyways. I was super depressed for no reason. I think my hormones were just going crazy and the weather was not helping. It was cool though because on our rainy drive, I had a moment when the sun shone while the rain fell and it was so cool! I felt peace with some things and had a nice moment with God that I really needed. Things started to look up more and more the rest of the day. We met a super nice man named Vernon who told us some really cool stories about his time in the navy. We also went to go stop by Matt and he wasn’t home, so we decided to knock somewhere neaby. There were some cute cats on the driveway, so I asked the cat which house we should knock on and the cat started walking forward, so we decided to knock on the door in front of us. We ended up meeting Brooklyn who was interested in coming to church, so that was really cool! I guess cats can be an answer to a prayer haha. Later that day, we also had a lesson with Dynamite which lifted both of our moods for the day.

On Friday, I had a super rough morning. My depression was super bad. I took that as a sign that Satan was trying to stop me from going to our lessons for the day, so I decided to push forward anyways and we had an amazing day! We were able to meet with the Overbys and figure out why they weren’t coming to church. Apparently, they had a hard time being on time and once they would miss the sacrament, they didn’t think it worth coming anymore. We were able to let them know that the young single adult congregation meets right after so they can still take the sacrament. They were so happy to hear that! We were also able to have a super amazing lesson with Dynamite at the church with the Mosers! We decided to combine our lesson with music and it was so special! Dynamite definitely felt the spirit! We invited him to be baptized, but he has some concerns about it. He just needs some more time learning, thinking, and praying about it. Later that day, we also ended up meeting this super nice lady named Cathy! We were able to talk about family history and she seemed to like that!

On Saturday, we decided to drop off cookies which was super fun! We ended up meeting Sister Perry who is super sweet and amazing! It was so fun getting to know her! We also tried to drop off cookies for a bunch of other people, but no one seemed to be home and it was scorching hot. I was starting to have signs of heat exhaustion, so we went back home. After having lunch and dinner, we went back out and tried to stop by Konah and James, but they weren’t home. I was starting to have another depressive episode on the way home and Sister Oliver talked to me and helped me remember the true power of having faith in the Savior. She played me her uncle’s song he wrote about the healing power of the Savior and it was so needed. It left me pondering a lot that night. Sadly, we also found out that both me and Sister Oliver would be leaving Newark.

The next morning on Sunday at church, almost every single talk and lesson was exactly what I needed. I learned so much about the Savior and His Atonement. I learned that while we can’t choose our trials or our emotions, we can choose to be grateful and let the Savior become the focus of our lives. Then even the hardest moments are softened by the healing power of the Savior. It was so needed to remember that hope that comes through Jesus Christ. Since this all, I have been more happy than I have been in a while. It’s like the light of the Savior filled any darkness that plagued my life. He filled the space that was empty and hopeless with hope, light, and healing. I have come to have a strong testimony that the Savior can change any heart, heal any soul, and bring light into our darkest moments. It was actually super amazing, because we were able to meet with Sister Alley again. She had told us she had started reading a chapter from the Old Testament, New Testament, and the Book of Mormon each day and had been writing in her journal. The difference between the last time we met with her and that day was like day and night. She was happier, her home was brighter, and you could just tell by the spirit of the room. The power of the Savior is real and if you feel like you are in a dark place, I would invite you to let the light of the Savior into your life in whatever way that looks to you. 

Anyways, I hope you all had a great week and that you are able to feel the love of the Savior in your life.
