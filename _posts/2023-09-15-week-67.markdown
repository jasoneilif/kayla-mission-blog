Hello everyone!

I hope you all had a great week! It's been a crazy week and a half! I don't think I have time to give a full update, so I'll just write about the week before that I missed and next Monday, I will give the update for this week.

On Monday, we had a crazy preparation day! We went to a cool park in Sewell and ran/walked and then played kickball afterwards. It was so fun! I almost made it to home base once, but they got me out. It was funny because on Tuesday all day, I was super sore all over. After doing our chores and communicating home, we called Eric and had an ok lesson with him. It didn’t go very well and was kind of all over the place. After that, we had a lesson with Rhein and Debra was able to join and share some of her thoughts. It was pretty good! 

On Tuesday, we had district council and Sister Schmidt brought some yummy cookies! After district council, we all went to Chick-Fil-A for lunch which was really fun! After that, we went to France’s house for a lesson with him and Mary. President Cleveland was going to join too which was really cool! Once we got there though, Mary was there getting into her car. She said she would be back in 15 minutes, but that didn’t happen. Since Mary was gone, we didn’t have another woman with us and so we sat in our car and called President Cleveland and Frances. It was funny because Frances got out and started walking around in front of us and then President Cleveland came around in his car and parked next to us and invited Frances into his car. We ended up having a super fun lesson over the phone where we could see each other through our car windows. It was a really spiritual lesson too which was really cool! After our lesson with Frances, we decided to walk to Jemaine’s house for his lesson even though it was far away and it was scorching hot outside and we ended up running into Andrew and inviting him to church and he said yes! Our lesson with Jemaine went really well and his girlfriend Brittany wanted to pray with us! After that, we had a call with our sister training leaders to review our goals and then we tried to have a lesson with Natalie, but she didn’t answer the door. After dinner, we went to Debra’s for a lesson with the Lastiques and it was really good! After that, we went to have a lesson with Betsaida and Jevemanie and it was so good! We taught them about the plan of salvation! It’s so sad though because they are moving to Indiana soon after their baptism. I will miss them so much! Hopefully their dad lets them be baptized! Their dad isn’t a member and we haven’t been able to meet him to ask.

On Wednesday, we had zone conference which was really good! It was a really spiritual zone conference! I sang one of my original songs with everyone and then shared my departing testimony with them. It was a really spiritual experience for me. I sang my song “Tossed” with them and shared about the Savior’s power to make more out of our imperfect efforts than we ever could imagine and how He can give us the strength we need because He understands and loves us perfectly. The other departing testimonies were also very spiritual and they were amazing! After the conference was done, we had some pizza and then went back home. We had a few lessons that fell through that night and got a lot of mosquito bites, but we were able to meet Kashief’s girlfriend who waa super nice and we set up a time to meet with her and Kashief! It was worth it! 

On Thursday, we had a crazy awesome day! Even before we started our missionary proselytizing hours, we found an amazing person who was prepared to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ! We were out on our morning walk, and we ended up going a totally different way than we normally do and we ended up meeting Aaron who was sitting outside of his house. We invited him to church and he said yes and we had a really cool conversation with him and told him we would call him later that day. After getting ready for the day, we had weekly planning which was good and then we went to Jemaine’s house for a lesson and this time we were going to meet his girlfriend Brittany! We ended up having an amazing lesson with them about God’s plan for us and Christ’s gospel. It was one of the most spiritual amazing lessons I have ever had and even though we taught them a lot of principles, it flowed so smoothly and they were participating so much that it didn’t even feel like two lessons worth of material. It was so cool! They are amazing! After that, we had a really fun time inviting people to church in this one area. It was really hot, but it was still fun! After that, we went home and had a needed break and we were able to cool down. Then we had an amazing lesson with our friend Josh! We invited him to be baptized in this lesson and taught him about God’s plan for His children and how baptism into Christ’s church allows us to enter into the gate of the path towards God’s kingdom. He said he would have to think about it for two years haha. We invited him to pray about what we taught and ask God if what we taught is true. After that, we had a great lesson with Aaron. Apparently, his friend in Liberia had learned about the Gospel from missionaries there and had already been baptized! 

On Friday, I had to go to the eye doctor because my eye hurt a little and I was worried because my nose was runny on one side. By the time I actually got into the eye doctor’s though, my eye felt fine but the Gatrell’s said I should still go to make sure I was fine and could wear my contacts. At the eye doctor’s they put numbing drops and orange dye in my eye and it gave me a headache and made me feel worse than I was before the appointment. When the eye doctor came to tell me what my diagnosis was, they said I had dry eyes and had a lot of buildup and eye goobers around my eye and that using this special wipe would take care of that. When I looked in the mirror, in the car, I was like well now I have a lot of buildup! It’s all the orange dye and numbing drops that my eye didn’t like and tried to get rid of! Anyways, that was an interesting experience! After the eye doctor appointment, it was a little rough. Our lesson with London didn’t go super well and I was not having a good time. We were able to go to the Williams afterwards and have a fun time with them! Sister Williams shared about how she joined the church and it was an amazing story! I think Friday was the day that the assistants called us and said that I was moving back to Medford to be companions with Sister Bull and I was so excited!!!

On Saturday, we went to Sister Winter’s to help her organize more of her clothes and it was really fun! It was also really cool because Sister Winter’s friend Lisa was there and we were able to teach her! She is an author and she had a lot of questions for us! After that, we had dinner at Wendy’s because it was on the way. Then we went to have a lesson with Betsaida and Jevemanie. It was so sad because they weren’t able to get in contact with their dad to ask if they could be baptized and they are moving to Indiana, so they might not be able to get baptized for a while. We had a fun lesson with them though! It was crazy though because Betsaida offered us lemonade. Little did we know that it wasn’t just lemonade, it was lemonade iced tea. Iced tea has been revealed by the Lord through a prophet of God that it isn’t good for us to consume, so I had been avoiding it, but accidentally consumed it all because I didn't want to being it into the car. Sister Jarvis and Sister Scott did though and then told me after taking a few sips they noticed it said iced tea on the container. I was like "oh no!" It was an accident though, so I didn't worry too much. A little bit after talking to them, I started to get really jittery and talkative though and I realized that it had caffeine! That night I was literally bouncing off the walls and couldn't sit still for an hour. I was going crazy! I didn't feel like myself. After an hour of constant jitteriness and singing and walking, I finally crashed and was able to calm down. That was an interesting experience haha. Hopefully no one sneaks anything else on me!

On Sunday, I was fasting for Jevemanie and Betsaida and that was really good! I still haven't heard about if things worked out with the move to Indiana, but I hope it went well! We also went to Tinamarie's baptism which was really good! I spent some time packing and preparing to move to Medford! I literally could not believe I was going to get to be companions with her especially since she is still a sister training leader with Sister Spencer!

On Monday, I officially became companions with Sister Bull and moved to Medford! It was super unreal! It kind of felt like an exchange at first, but it also kind of felt like I never left in the first place haha. We ended up going to a few different places to invite people to church and ended up meeting some really cool people! We met Edith, Devin, Kris, and Milton! Devin actually ended up being really cool and we had two lessons later in the week! It was such a good day!

Anyways, I'll tell you all about the rest later! Have a great weekend!
