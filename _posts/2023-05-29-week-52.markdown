Happy Memorial Day!

This week was kind of an emotional rollercoaster. I know I say that a lot, but I have no other way to describe it haha. There were a lot of really cool miracles, but it was also really sad because we found out that Sister Oliver is being transferred to a different area, so I will have a new companion here in Medford, New Jersey. I will definitely miss her a ton!

Monday was an interesting day. It started out like a normal preparation day, but it went by so fast and we realized we hadn’t eaten anything, so we stopped by a nearby Amish market. Sadly we found out it is only open on Friday and Saturday. We looked around the area for food and found a Popeyes. Neither of us had tried Popeye’s so we decided to go there. We had to head back home though to do some missionary work since preparation day was over and on the car ride over we got a phone call from Brother Lucas’s daughter saying that Brother Lucas had fallen and fractured his hip and was getting surgery. We were super sad to hear that news and when we finally got home, we were greeted by questionable chicken that I wasn’t sure if it was raw or not and missing chicken for Sister Oliver. The Sanchez’s must be in tune with the spirit because they called us and randomly invited us over to Rita’s. Then they had us come over for dinner. It was very needed to just be at their house and forget about the sad news and sad chicken. We were able to teach Norma about tithing using pennies and it was so fun! We also played ultimate tic tac toe. Unfortunately, we didn’t even start eating until 9pm because we had gotten back from Rita’s so late. I scarfed down my food as fast as I could but we weren’t able to get out until 9:40. I kind of had a panic attack on the way home worrying about getting home so late past curfew. Luckily, we were able to get home safely, but I had to calm my nerves for a while.

On Tuesday, we went to district council and that went well! We had lunch all together at McDonalds and then me and Sister Oliver went back to the church to write more of our song and get the flier ready for the Book of Mormon night. I was feeling kind of out of it for no reason, but we went out to a neighborhood to knock and I just couldn’t get myself to do it. After a mental break, I finally pushed myself to get out of the car. Sadly, we didn’t find anyone who wanted to come to church. We went home feeling mentally drained from the day and were about to have our dinner break when Brother Sanchez called and invited us to come over to dinner again. We gratefully accepted and went over. We had some burgers for an outdoor grill and that was really good! It was nice just sitting outside and it helped my mood! They seriously know when we are having a hard time somehow! This time when we left, we were able to get back home on time.

On Wednesday, we served at the thrift store again which was fun and then we did a lot of missionary work on the phone. Later that night, we had our lesson with the Guthe’s like usual, but this time was really special. I had the thought while praying earlier that day to study about the spirit. I came across the section in Preach My Gospel about the spirit and thought the Guthe’s would like it. When we actually went over there, it was such a spiritual lesson. We shared with each other our experiences when we felt the spirit testify to us of Jesus Christ and His love for us. I shared this one experience I had a while ago when I was in my astronomy class and we were watching a video on the big dome theater about the scale of the universe and how the sun is a speck compared to another star and that star is a speck compared to another star and how that star is a speck compared to a galaxy and how that galaxy is a speck compared to the universe. I had this overwhelming feeling of love come over me because I realized that Jesus Christ created all the grandeur of the universe for me, but also how even though He could love these grand creations or millions of creations, He loves me. I am so small compared to everything and yet He knows and loves me individually and infinitely even down to the tiniest atom or particle of my soul. I couldn’t help but cry a little remembering this experience and looking back over that lesson, I realized that it healed me. I had been dealing with depression and anxiety symptoms and had an episode for a few weeks. I felt empty and hollow inside and cried almost every day for no reason at all, but after recalling that experience, it’s like all the hurt in my heart was replaced with joy and I felt something where there was nothing. I felt pure love and I didn’t realize just how much I had missed feeling this way. I know that the Lord healed me somehow and I am so grateful for that. I couldn’t help but think of the times in the Bible and Book of Mormon when the Savior heals the wounded eyes, ears, legs, and sickness. I feel like He healed my heart and my spirit, and I couldn’t be more joyful!

On Thursday, this joy continued into the next day and I finally felt like myself again. I had felt really bad for Sister Oliver because she had been around the sad version of me for so long and she had been doing her best to support me and give me all the help she could. It was probably really draining for her, but she continued to help me and was my friend through it all. I am so grateful for her and will miss her when she leaves. It was so nice being able to give something back and act like myself again. Anyways, we had lunch at Freedom Park and did a bunch of missionary work there on our phones. We even met this really cool guy named Nick who just stopped by our bench and started talking to us about a lot of different things. He was so happy to talk to us and even told us a little bit about the tree we were sitting next to. We gave him our number and church info and we were so happy to have talked to him! We were about to leave when the ice cream truck came to the park and Sister Oliver and I couldn’t resist because we hadn’t really gotten ice cream from the ice cream truck before that we can remember. After eating our cold treat, we went to Dawn’s house, but she wasn’t there. We decided to knock down a nearby street and we met Peter who was super excited to see us and he said he might come to church! After that, we went to Sister Foulk’s house for dinner and had a yummy meal of stuffed peppers. After that, we had planned to go on Main Street to invite people to church since we had seen Food Trucks on Thursdays and lots of people. It was funny though because when we got there, there were no food trucks or people. We did invite this one guy and his dog though! We decided to try walking further and knocking on this one street and there weren’t a lot of people who wanted to come to church. It was so funny also because we parked really far away. It kind of gave us a mental break walking back though since no one had said they wanted to come to church.

On Friday, we had a lesson with Dave and Sister Sheridan! It was really good! After our lesson with them, we tried to stop by the hospital to visit Brother Lucas, but we found out as soon as we got there that we had just missed him and he had been discharged from the hospital to a rehab physical therapy facility. We decided to do some stop bys which turned out really good! We met quite a few people so our trip to the hospital was definitely not a waste. After our stop bys, we went to the Vancour’s house for dinner and had a yummy basil tomato pasta with cheese. It was so good! Their family is so fun to be around!

On Saturday, we went to the church to finish the Book of Mormon study flier and also start making Rick’s baptism program. Then we had a lesson with Bob and Cheryl and the Guthe’s came with us. It was so cool because Bob was able to get along nicely with the Guthes and had a good time while Sister Oliver showed Cheryl the Gospel Library app. Then we went home and were about to have dinner and Sister Oliver was kind of sad because the lesson was a little awkward, and then Brother Sanchez called. That is the third time they just knew we needed help. We went over to their house and had fun kicking a ball with the kids while they cooked dinner outside and then we had to have a lesson with John which went really well and we were able to teach him so much! He is definitely on the way to baptism! He even came to church on Sunday!

On Sunday, we had an awesome lesson with Sister Hatton’s daughter Isabella’s boyfriend named Jason! It went really well and he seemed to really enjoy it!

Anyways, I hope you all have a great week and a great memorial day! Remember you are never alone and that God loves you!
