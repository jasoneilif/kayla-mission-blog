Lyrics:

Verse 1:  
Jesus, our Lord and Savior,  
The One who came to save us,  
A perfect example of love,  
Sent to us from above.  

Chorus:  
He is kind and compassionate,  
Patient and forgiving,  
Full of grace and full of mercy,  
Jesus, our King of Kings.  

Verse 2:
Jesus, our Lord and Savior,  
The One who came to save us,  
May we follow His example,  
And live a life full of love and grace.  

Chorus:  
He is kind and compassionate,  
Patient and forgiving,  
Full of grace and full of mercy,  
Jesus, our King of Kings.  

Bridge:  
He is the light in our darkness,  
The hope in our despair,  
The anchor for our souls,  
And the answer to our prayers.  

Chorus:  
He is kind and compassionate,  
Patient and forgiving,  
Full of grace and full of mercy,  
Jesus, our King of Kings.  

He is kind and compassionate,  
Patient and forgiving,  
Full of grace and full of mercy,  
Jesus, our King of Kings.  

Outro:  
He walked the earth with humility,  
Served and loved with simplicity,  
Gave His life as a sacrifice,  
To give us eternal life.  

For He is kind and compassionate,  
Patient and forgiving,  
Full of grace and full of mercy,  
Jesus, our King of Kings.
