Hi everyone! Sorry it’s been so long since I last wrote! I was going to write two Mondays ago, but we had district preparation day, which took all of our time to do anything else. I also would have written this Monday, but we had our preparation day moved to Thursday so we could go to the temple. It’s been a crazy couple of weeks!

On Monday the 20th, we had a member meal with Sister Horn and it’s been really good reading preach my gospel (a missionary manual to help missionaries be more effective) with her. She actually joined us on a lesson this week and it went pretty well!

Tuesday was pretty typical, but Wednesday was exciting! We had a lesson with Ama-edi which went pretty good! We also had a lesson with our new friend Van! Sister Horn came on the lesson and we talked about the Book of Mormon and invited him to read it! He hasn’t gotten into it yet, but he seems interested in learning!

That Thursday, we heart-attacked Nneka’s door with paper heart notes since we hadn’t heard from Nneka for a while. She really enjoyed seeing that! Sadly the next day on the 24th, she didn’t answer the door for her lesson and she wasn’t responding to her texts. We were going to have Sister Thompson come with us. Hopefully, we can have a lesson with Nneka and Sister Thompson! Luckily, we did have our lesson with Sister Boon! We put up her certificates on her wall for her and read our chapter. She is such a cool lady! She influences all the people around her and it’s so cool to see all the things she’s done in her life to help others! We also had a phone call lesson with our friend Lindsey! Sister Moore was able to join on the lesson and it was so cool because we were able to figure out why Lindsey wasn’t coming to church! She was just afraid of being judged, so Sister Moore was able to help her overcome that fear! Hopefully she comes to the Easter Sunday service! That would be so cool! Sister Moore is so sweet and a great friend to Lindsey! She writes us letters every week and gives them to us every Sunday!

Saturday morning was pretty much a typical missionary morning, but Saturday evening was pretty eventful! The Wolfgramms invited us and the Cherry Hill 1 elder’s friend Naveen over for dinner! It was really cool and we had some really good food! I think it’s called chop su (I don’t know if I got the spelling right). We ended up staying at their house for 3 hours and it was really good! I think it was especially special for Sister Foukimoana because she’s related to them!

On Sunday, we had a good church service!

On Monday the 27th, we had district preparation day which was really fun! We hung out in the church building and played games and ate food! We also went to Costco and looked around! We also got a rotisserie chicken lol. It was also raining while sunny so we saw a beautiful rainbow!

I don’t remember which day, but it was a miracle because we met the sweetest lady named Shelby! She let us in and showed us her house and her family!

We also had a miracle where we were visiting someone who had put in a request and we actually ran into their mom who was actually a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints! She was so excited for us to teach her and her daughter and to come to church!

On Friday the 31st, we tried to have another lesson with Nneka, but it fell through again! We were super worried about her! We did have a good lesson with Sister Boon though!

On Saturday, we had General Conference, a special worldwide meeting where the prophet and his apostles speak, broadcasted at the church building! We had invited at least 200 people to General Conference and quite a few of them said they were going to come! We were so excited! The first session, a few members came, but none of our friends came and the next session not even the members came and it was only me and Sister Foukimoana in the building. Norman was supposed to come to this session, but his bike broke down so he didn’t end up making it. For the last session, we went home so we could make it back before curfew. We had dinner and right before the last session was about to start, it started to pour rain and there was lighting and thunder. The winds started to pick up and the mission office sent a message saying there was a tornado warning and to stay away from outside walls and windows. I looked on the weather app and sure enough there was a tornado watch for New Jersey! Who knew New Jersey could have tornados! We decided to get our emergency supplies and watch general conference in our basement. Luckily, by the time we finished watching, the tornado warning was gone and there was only a wind warning. It was a crazy day!

On Sunday, we got a message from the Cherry Hill 1 elders that they were going to their bishop’s house for breakfast before General Conference and that we were invited! It was super fun and they made some crepes which were really good! After breakfast, we headed to the church to set up for General Conference. It was so cool because Marvin our new member friend as well as the Marvin we had met at McDonalds came. Eddie, another person we had randomly texted from our contacts came as well! He enjoyed it so much that he came to the next session and brought a friend with him! The Cherry Hill 1 elders also came and brought their friend Naveen and some cinnamon rolls Elder Ogden had made! It was super fun! The next session, there wasn’t as many people who were there, but it was still really good!

On Monday April 3rd, we had a normal missionary day instead of a preparation day, so we did some stop bys.

On Tuesday, we had district council and we gave a training from adjusting to missionary life, a booklet to help us manage our emotions and health and the stresses of everyday life as a missionary. We also had district lunch and went to panda express. It was so good! After that, we stopped by some people since our lesson fell through. We headed back home, but our street was completely blocked off for construction, so we parked a few streets down and walked about 8 minutes to our house. We packed our bags to go to exchanges in Vineland, NJ and after doing some missionary work online, we walked with our bags all the way back to the car. People probably saw us and thought we were homeless. We drove to Vineland and then did some contacting in the car before going in. It was super cool because we set up a lot of lessons with our friends for Saturday!

Exchanges on Wednesday were super fun! I was with Sister Bull again and we had a great time! We got to meet this super nice guy while knocking on doors who was talking about the passover! He wasn’t interested in meeting with us, but he was nice! We also had an awesome lesson with Ronald! We taught about the Plan of Salvation and it was so spiritual! He seemed to really like knowing what happens to those who aren’t baptized and how God’s plan is so merciful! We had a fun lunch break where we played a card game and ate some yummy curry a member had made! We also had a funny and slightly chaotic member meal with one of the families in their congregation! I felt like I had met them! Even their sister Carol who wasn’t a member of the church! It was really fun and the food was really good!

Today, we had the opportunity to go to the temple and it was very needed! I was so grateful that everything finally worked out to go to the temple! Sadly I totally forgot to reserve and print a name beforehand. It was a good experience though and I feel like I needed that! I love the temple! The Schmidts were so nice and took us there! It was so cool because I saw so many people that I knew there including the hermanas, Sister Moore and Sister Williams from my congregation, Sister Shelton and Brother Engle from my last area, and a few elders from the mission. After going to the temple, the Schmidts took us out to eat and then gave us a tour of their building including taking us on the top floor with the beautiful view! It was so cool!

Anyways, I hope you all have a great week! I’ll try not to miss too many more weeks lol! Happy Easter! Speaking of Easter, I just wanted to share this since it is Easter. I have been learning over the last little bit that Jesus Christ is not just the backup plan if we make mistakes, He is the plan. He can be our strength though each day to be forgiven, overcome weaknesses, find hope and joy, and endure trials. We all go through individual challenges and He knows exactly how each of us feel since He felt it with us in the garden of Gethsemane. He also knows exactly how to strengthen and help us, and is waiting for us to turn to Him in faith trusting that He can do all things and that He will help us become who we need to be.
