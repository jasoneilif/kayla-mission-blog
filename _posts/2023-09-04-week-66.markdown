Hello everyone!

This week has been

On Monday, we ended up going to a nearby place and we met some really cool people! We were going to stop by someone who we hadn’t been able to get in contact with. It was so cool because while we were working our way to her house, we ended up meeting this really cool guy named Shaquan. He isn’t too sure about the Book of Mormon, but he said he would come to church. We eventually made it to the person’s house we were going to stop by and they answered from the upstairs window and said that they didn’t mean to send in the request and it was an accident. We decided to knock on some doors on the way back and we ended up meeting Eric! Eric just started talking with us randomly on his doorstep. He told us about a lot of the challenges he’s going through but how he knows God loves Him and isn’t giving him these trials and is on his side. He also shared that he sings in a gospel choir which was really cool! He also apparently had received a copy of the Book of Mormon from his sister in law which is crazy!

On Tuesday, we had district council which was really good! After district council, we decided to stop by Frances because Sister Jarvis had a prompting. Frances didn’t answer, but we did happen to be in the right place to meet Kashief! It was really cool! After that, we decided to go to this neighborhood and stop by some people. We ended up meeting this really nice man named Charles and this nice lady named Sasha and a cool guy named Joe who was working on a house. We invited his coworker to church but he said no. We decided to stop by some people in a different neighborhood and drove 10 minutes away. We were almost there and we invited some people along the way. One guy we invited stopped and said we had already invited him. Confused, we took a closer look and it was the coworker of Joe! We were so shocked that he would be there of all people. We told him there are no coincidences and that God led our paths together and invited him to church again, but he said no again. We gave him a card this time just in case. We proceeded to do our stop bys we had planned and knocked around them. We also started knocking a few random buildings and near the end we ran into the same guy again! It was crazy! That was the third time we had run into him and there was no way that was planned or a coincidence. We invited him again, but he said no. God was definitely reaching out to him that day haha. He probably thought we were really weird or were following him. It’s ok though. Maybe he will eventually come! We knocked on one more building and then we were about to head back and there was loud cursing and we looked over and saw a man beating up a woman. We were kind of hidden, so we walked quickly around the buildings towards our car to avoid the dangerous situation. It was so scary. He started driving circles around the apartments cursing into his phone. We finally made it to our car and once we were able to drive to a safe place, we called the police and they were already on it so that was good! It was crazy! Sister Jarvis was really worried about calling and reporting it and it really scared her. I knew we needed to get out of the situation though and was surprisingly calm throughout the whole situation which was a huge miracle because if both of us were too anxious to move on, we might have ended up in a bad situation. Luckily we were able to go to Debra’s house for a lesson and she helped Sister Jarvis feel better after the whole situation.

On Wednesday, we served at Sister Winter’s house and organized her clothes and jewelry. It was super cool! She had a lot of antique jewelry and she let us take some of it with us since she didn’t want it. After that, we went to the dentist’s office for Sister Jarvis and met some really nice ladies. After doing some stop bys and contacting some people, we went over to Katiana and Dunique’s house. It was so fun! Katiana’s son Nathan was so cute and he was so excited to see us missionaries. Kendra also came with us and it was a party! We shared a message with them and had fun getting to know them!

On Thursday, after weekly planning, we decided to do some stop bys on the way to interviews. We ended up meeting Josh at this random park and he is super cool! We also met this super nice guy named Errol! Then we headed to interviews with President Harding which were really good! I am coming home in October, so we talked a little bit about that. I am definitely sad to be leaving, but I know being home will be good and I am so excited to use the skills I have learned on my mission in my normal everyday life. Something I remember Brother Garcia from Valley Forge saying is that when I go home, my area is just expanded to the whole world. Sometimes I feel like my mission experience in a large way has just a training ground for me to become a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. After interviews, we had dinner and then had a lesson with Pedro who is trying to get back to church. Then we had a crazy phone lesson with this one guy we met on the street. He wasn’t in a good place to be in a lesson and it was to the point where we had to hang up. We think he was in a strip club during our lesson because he started talking to these two girls who were acting inappropriate. It was crazy!

On Friday, we had a crazy day! We went out around our apartment complex to invite people to church and we ended up meeting some really cool people! We met Jermaine who was really cool as well as London who was interested in coming to church and Natalie. It was really cool because with Natalie, we ended up being able to share with her about what happens after we die and how we will be able to see our loved ones again and have perfected bodies that don’t experience death or sickness any more. We had a call with Jane after that, so we decided to go to a nearby bench and on the way, we randomly ran into Frances and it was so fun catching up with him! He is doing well! Our call with Jane went well too! It was a little hot sitting on the bench, but it was a beautiful view so that made it better! After that, we decided to do some stop bys after our lesson with Sharon. Sadly, Sharon didn’t answer the door, but we did end up meeting a really cool family who speaks Portuguese! The dad didn’t know any English, but his daughter did and she was so nice! Hopefully they come to church! There are a lot of people here that speak Portuguese so they would be able to make some friends in the congregation! We also ended up meeting some other cool people like Stanley, Sonja, Jose, Shawn, and Amanda. Amanda only spoke Spanish, so I tried to talk with her in my broken Spanish and thankfully I was at least able to understand her and get across a general message. She was so sweet though! Later that day, we randomly called people hoping to have a lesson with one of them. We ended up calling Josh who we met at the park and had an amazing lesson with him! Debra joined the lesson and shared a powerful testimony with him. The spirit was definitely there!

On Saturday, we went to the temple with Debra for her first time and it was awesome! It was so crazy because we hadn’t even made it inside and I happened to run into Edgar from Valley Forge! He had moved to Mexico right after I left so I was so surprised to see him. He had just received his endowment! It was so cool! The actual temple trip was good! Debra seemed to really like it! It was a little rough with the baptism part because it was Debra’s first time doing baptisms for the dead and the person baptizing her had never performed a baptism before. It worked out eventually and Debra was able to do it! After the temple trip, we went to a nearby place called Sabrina’s to eat and it was really good! I had a salmon bowl which was so good! After that, we went back to our area and we went to go help the Scott’s dog go to the bathroom. We tried so many different things, but Dexter the dog was super anxious to be outside and even when we got him out, he just sat by the door. We were so worried he would go to the bathroom in the house. Luckily the Scott’s said this happens a lot. We came back a second time and this time Dexter went to the bathroom a little bit. After that, we went to a nearby neighborhood and ended up meeting Paula who was super cool and we also met Beverly. She was so smiley and happy and we talked a lot. It was crazy because 5 minutes before we came, she had just prayed to God expressing that she was lonely and then we showed up at her door!

On Sunday, it was such a cool experience! Our friend Josh came to church on Sunday and got a ride with the Scott’s and he got along really well with everyone and really enjoyed church. Brittney also came to church which was amazing! She was baptized when she was 12, but she hadn’t been since then and this was her first Sunday back. She shared her testimony with everyone and it was so powerful. She got right back into the swing of things and she loved it so much! It was such a special day for her! The actual meeting was awesome! Every single testimony shared by people was so powerful and there were only a few with dry eyes! After church we tried to have some lessons, but they didn’t work out. Then we went to the Scott’s for dinner and had a great time with them!

Anyways, I hope you all have a great week! You are all amazing!

1 Ok quick story. Basically there was a random wasp in our house and we asked Elder Lewis what to do about it and he said hit it with a towel. That didn't seem like a good idea but Sister Jarvis tried it while the wasp was behind the blinds and it didn't do anything. Later the wasp was on my bed and I just threw the towel from a distance because I was scared and it landed on the wasp. I didn't see it come out, so I quickly grabbed a bowl and put it on top of the towel and bunched it  up. Somehow I got the wasp in the bowel and the towel separate. We called it our pet and kept it on the bed until it was dead and then I threw it outside.
