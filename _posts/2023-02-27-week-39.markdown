Hello everyone!

I hope you all had a great week! This email may be a bit rushed or confusing because transfers are tomorrow so we are running all over today. Sister Moore is saying goodbye to a lot of our friends and members here before she goes. She is being transferred to Linwood. I'm sad because I only got to be companions with her for one transfer. I will miss Sister Moore. It's ok though! I will be companions with Sister Foukimoana. I am super excited to meet her!

This week has felt like two weeks! Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday all felt like last week lol.

Tuesday was pretty fun! After district council, we drove to Vineland for exchanges with Sister Giles and Sister Bull. It unexpectedly started pouring rain on us and I was worried about that because I didn't bring a rain jacket or boots. It was a miracle because as soon as we made it to their apartment, there was half blue sky then like a night and day difference, it was sunny with blue sky and barely any clouds in the sky. I had a lot of fun with Sister Giles on exchanges. We were about to go, when we realized that we had both of the sims. We drove back to the house and knocked on the door because they only have one set of keys, but Sister Bull and Sister Moore had already left. Since they didn't have the sims, we weren't able to contact them, so we drove around looking for them since the car was still parked in the parking lot. After a while of driving around looking for them, we got a text from them saying they were at home. It was a miracle because the wifi there is really bad, but it somehow was able to work enough for them to send that message. We gave them one of the sim cards and then headed to the Hoffmans house. It was such a good lesson, and we had a great discussion with them! They are great missionaries and have such strong testimonies! After that, we went back to the apartment and Sister Giles made us all some fajitas. They were super good! It was so fun being companions with my first trainer for the day! It was so cool seeing how both of us had grown on our missions after 7 months.

The next day, we went home and after taking a short break, we drove to the North of our area in Collingswood and spent pretty much the whole day there. We stopped by a lot of people. Sadly a lot of people weren't home, but we were able to see Marian again and pray with her. After spending the day in Collingswood, we went to the Chamberlains house for dinner. Sister Chamberlain had made some hungarian chicken which was super good! After getting home, we had a lesson with Ama-edi which was good, but it was hard for him to understand how Joseph Smith fit into the message of the restoration. We tried explaining it 3 or 4 different ways before we had to close off. We decided we would have to try again another day.

On Thursday, we had an early lesson before weekly planning with a different Troy than the one we had been meeting with. It was such a spiritual lesson and it was so powerful to be able to testify of Jesus Christ and the Book of Mormon. It was such a good lesson. He talked throughout the lesson and had great insights and experiences. We asked if he wanted a copy of the Book of Mormon though and he just said "no", said a quick goodbye and hung up. I was so surprised by that. The lesson was going so well and we thought that he was interested, but I guess he wasn't. I guess the good thing is that we were able to remember in that lesson how much the gospel of Jesus Christ means to us. After that lesson, we planned out our week and then stopped by some people and gave George his large Book of Mormon. He was so excited to get it finally. Then we went home and contacted people on our phones since all of our lessons that night got cancelled.

On Friday, we had a lesson with Nneka which was so good, but she expressed her concerns with us that she was being forced to be baptized and rushed. We were so sad to hear that. She said that the member we had on her last lesson had hurt her feelings and had told her other things when she was alone with Nneka that were unnecessary and too soon. We will probably have to take her off date and slow down the pace. I still don't know what we will say to the member that told her these things, but I know that the member had good intentions and just wanted to help. Maybe we can somehow help the member learn how she can be a better missionary and use her boldness to share the gospel at the right times and places. She really is an amazing person and her desire to help in the missionary work is so inspirational. Hopefully things will work out for the better!

Anyways, after our lesson with Nneka, we headed to Sister Boon's house for our weekly lesson with her. We watched the Book of Mormon video about how Nephi, a writer in the Book of Mormon, followed the directions of the Lord and made a boat in the wilderness having faith. His brothers Laman and Lemuel didn't believe that Nephi could do that and mocked him. Nephi kept on going though and didn't let his brothers stop him. With direction from the Lord, Nephi was able to make a boat and his family sailed to the Americas. Even after Laman and Lemuel saw how their brother was able to build a ship with help from the Lord and even after they had already experienced so many miracles by staying faithful, Laman and Lemuel rebelled and tied up their brother Nephi. It was only after the Lord sent a storm and they were afraid of dying that Laman and Lemuel repented and untied Nephi. It made me think about how sometimes we can go through the same experiences and either come out more faithful or more hardened. All three of them traveled through the wilderness for many days and they were raised by the same parents and even all saw an angel, but Nephi had faith and turned to the Lord during his trials and Laman and Lemuel just complained and rebelled. Sometimes it's easy to complain when we go through trials or doubt, but if we instead turn to the Lord through our trials and have faith, we will be more happy and blessed.

Anyways, that was a really cool lesson with Sister Boon. After that, we went to the Buendia's house and cleaned for them. It was really fun and I got in a good cleaning mood. We had fun talking to them and it was fun seeing their reaction to the clean rooms. They fed us some lasagna and we had dinner with them which was also super fun! 

On Saturday, we had another lesson with Ama-edi and it went a lot better than last time. Ama-edi understood us a lot better! He asked if we could send him resources so he can understand better so we will see what he thinks about it. We know that he will be able to receive an answer to whether or not the Book of Mormon is true and if Joseph Smith was a prophet if he asks with a sincere heart with real intent. We are so excited for him! After our lesson with Ama-edi, we stopped by some people who had expressed interest in our message and then went to the Wolfgram's house for dinner. It was so nice of them because they invited our friend Marvin too! The food was so good and it was so cool because they shared a lot of their personal experiences coming to Christ and visiting the temple and it was such a spiritual conversation! They were so welcoming and friendly to Marvin and it made us so happy to see that! Both of them have such strong testimonies!

On Sunday, it was so cool because David and Darrel both came to church! We were so excited to see them there! It was kind of bitter sweet having Sister Moore say goodbye to everyone. After church, we went to William's baptism in Pennsauken! Sister Moore had taught him for a while and both of us had taught him over the phone before he started going to the other congregation in Pennsauken with Elder Vakalahi and Elder Eddington. It was such a happy day and William said he felt really good! After Wiilliam's baptism, we went to dinner at the Wynne's house which was really good! We had a really yummy dinner and some good conversation. That night back home, we had an all mission call and found out where Sister Moore was going and who my new companion was going to be.

This next week should be super fun! I am super excited to meet Sister Foukimoana! I will let you all know how that goes next Monday! Have a great week!
