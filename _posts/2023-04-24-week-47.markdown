Hello everyone!

This week has been one big learning experience and miracle!

On Tuesday, we had a good first district council as a new district! We have the zone leaders in our district so that has been interesting! We had a really cool discussion together and there were a lot of thoughts others shared that I really liked! After district council, we went to Wendy’s for lunch which was really fun! Afterwards, we were trying to decide what to do and we decided that we would stop by some people! We ended up stopping by Mousumi’s house and we met her husband Supertim and they said we could come by another time when they weren’t on a work call. We also went this other place, and it was crazy because we were passing by this one house and a lady pulled up. The person didn’t answer and we walked back and another lady had pulled in and was talking to the other lady. We had already passed by when I had the thought to go talk to them and compliment the lady. So hesitantly, against my embarrassment, we went back and Sister Oliver tried starting a conversation, but the lady said she was in the middle of something and that she couldn’t talk, so we said goodbye and started walking away. We got to the intersection and I felt so bad for not following through with my prompting to compliment this lady. We decided to continue on and I had the number 45 pop into my head and I was so confused. We were on a street that had numbers in the 40s, but when we looked at the map, there was 43, 44, 46, and 47 but not 45. We gave up on that idea and Sister Oliver just remembered that there was someone we hadn’t stopped by on the street, so we went back past the lady’s house and she wasn’t outside anymore. We knocked on the other person’s door and on the way back, I felt like I needed to knock on the lady’s door. I was freaking out a little and was trying to talk with Sister Oliver on her driveway trying to figure out what to say to her and just at that moment, she opened her front door and came out. She told us that we had already come by and that she wasn’t interested. We explained that we just wanted to come back to compliment her on her hair and she was confused, but it did leave a smile on her face, so that was cool! Heavenly Father definitely gave me another chance to follow that prompting! Later that day, we had a lesson with our friend Irene which went really well! We also had a surprize dinner with the Sanchez family so that was fun!

On Wednesday, we had a meeting where we talked about how to use Facebook to help with missionary work. It was pretty good! Later, we stopped by some people and met this super nice lady named Kate! We were able to help her out around the house while simultaneously teaching her about the word of wisdom because she asked us about it! She is super sweet! Later after dinner, we went to Cheryl and Bob’s house and taught them the Plan of Salvation! It was another powerful lesson and we could feel the spirit strongly! We think they liked it! We are going to be reading some of the stories from the Book of Mormon to them and we are super excited because we think Bob will really enjoy it since it kind of aligns with the kind of movies and books he likes to watch and read. After our lesson with them, we rushed over to the Guthe’s house and had a lesson with them! It was super fun because we talked about some of their favorite hymns with them, and they really enjoyed that!

On Thursday, we did weekly planning like usual, but we had to do it later in the day because we went to visit Sister Branum first. It was a little awkward at times because we didn’t know her very well and we weren’t super good at small talk, but we were able to get to know her a little better and she is super sweet! She also has a cute little boy! We shared an uplifting message with her and she was super nice and gave us some delicious homemade bread. After meeting with Sister Branum, we went back home and planned out our week. Then we went to interviews with President Harding and it was very needed! I have been worrying about staying focused and keeping up with goals and schedules and after a few other suggestions, he shared with me about how it’s important to make a spiritual plan before a physical plan. I thought that was so cool because I have been trying so many things and it hasn’t been working. I realized that it would be so much easier if I turn to God first for help in planning and setting goals. Right after our interviews with President Harding, we went to Sister Foulk’s house and had a yummy dinner of chicken parmesan! After dinner, we did some stop bys and it was amazing because every single person answered! Our first stop was at this man named Will’s house. He was busy at the moment, but he was so thankful to have us give him a copy of the Book of Mormon! Next we went to a lady named Dawn’s house. She was super sweet and talked to us for a while! She accepted a copy of the Book of Mormon and was super happy to have us stop by again! Then, we went to Angela’s house! She wasn’t home, but her teenage daughter, Monica, opened the door and we were able to give her a copy of the Book of Mormon!

On Friday, we did even more stop bys! We tried to stop by a lady named Elaine’s house since a member from our congregation said she might appreciate talking to missionaries. We stopped by and ended up meeting Elaine and her husband and another lady who was helping them out. We knocked on her neighbor’s door and she answered and said we weren’t allowed to knock in the neighborhood since it says “no soliciting”. We tried to explain that we aren’t solicitors, but she was adamant that we leave, so we left. We were about to knock further down the street, but she came out and said “ladies, where is your car?” We looked at her and then slowly and awkwardly went back to our car while she watched us from her door. I think people just use the no soliciting sign as an excuse to kick us out, but we definitely aren’t solicitors. We didn’t want to cause contention unnecessarily with the lady though, so we left. We stopped by a few other people and on our way to one of the houses, we met a nice guy named Riel and his two kids who were sitting on their porch enjoying a nice spring day. He accepted a copy of the Book of Mormon and said we could stop by and study the Book of Mormon with him. We also stopped by Glenn and he was actually in his car. We gave him a copy of the  Book of Mormon as well! We also stopped by Viki! I was so happy to finally meet her! She was so sweet and her little daughter Luna was so cute! She was a “jungle princess” lol and she liked my polka dot nails! Viki was busy making lunch, but she was glad we stopped by! After Viki, we went to the Bennetts for dinner and we had breakfast burritos! It was so good! They are so fun! On the way out, we watered a sad looking plant with our half empty old water bottles and started heading home. I remembered that we hadn’t stopped by Stephaney and Sister Oliver did a u-turn and we headed to Stephaney’s house. We were glad that we turned around because Stephaney is so cool! We had fun getting to know her and it was so much better in person than over the phone!

On Saturday, we reached out to a lot of people over the phone and we did a lot of stop bys. It was pretty cool because we knocked in an area that felt a lot like a storybook village in the middle of the woods. The street we knocked on was called Moon way so that was pretty cool! We even met someone who was interested in learning more on this street so that was cool! We were about to knock on Tanglewood, but I felt like we needed to go straight to Ron’s house. We were going there and I also had a thought not to go down the driveway. At first I thought it was because it was really long, but after parking and walking to the driveway, we noticed a sign that said no trespassing unless we have an expected delivery. We weren’t sure if they would remember putting in a request so we left a note on his mailbox. It would have been bad if we would have gotten stuck in their driveway or if we had to back out into a busy street, so that must have been inspiration from God. We knocked on a few houses in the area, but no one answered. We did meet a nice couple who were trying to fix their windshield wipers and we were able to leave them smiling amidst the frustration of figuring out how to install the windshield wipers. After that, we went to the Reeves for dinner and they had invited Rick, one of our friends, over as well with Brother Haggley, Rick’s friend. It was super good and we all shared our feelings about Christ and it was super powerful. It was a little chaotic, but it turned out good! Hopefully Rick didn’t feel peer pressured by the Reeves to say he wanted to be baptized. We want to make sure he does it because he wants to and not because of what other people say.

On Sunday, we had a good church service and even had a fun munch and mingle afterwards! There was a lot of food and it was fun talking to everyone! After church, we decided to stop by a nearby park and do some of our missionary work and studies there! It was a beautiful day! It was only when a spider, worm, fly, and random bug on the bench came that we decided it was time to leave. We had a lot of fun at home planning out how we could help the people here in our congregation do missionary work and how we could keep track of our friends’ progress. We made some really good plans!

Today, I sadly got sick after doing some exercise today and my bowels were emptied from both ends. It was probably from the munch and mingle haha. I am doing a lot better now though so that’s good! 

Oh also we have two spiders in our bathroom who help with the ant infestation, so they are our pets lol.

I hope you all have a great week! Feel free to email me if you would like! I will do my best to respond to them when I have time on preparation days!
