Lyrics:  
  
Though everyone is scared  
I know that I am prepared  
Though I may be small  
I will stand up tall  
  
Because I know that the Lord is on my side  
I know that I will not win this foe  
I know  
  
That though I am small  
He makes me tall  
Though I might fall  
He'll help me through it all  
  
He will be my guide  
And he'll be by my side  
  
Trust in the Lord, trust in His name  
He is my Savior and He stays the same  
I will follow his way  
Though I may fall, he will help me through it all  
He is my staff, my sword, my light  
My strength, my song  
  
Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  
I will fear no evil.  
For thou art with me.  
Thy rod and thy staff,  
They comfort me!  
They comfort me!  
  
Trust in the Lord, trust in His name  
He is my Savior and He stays the same  
I will follow his way  
Though I may fall, he will help me through it all  
He is my staff, my sword, my light  
My strength, my song  
  
Trust in his name, and you'll make it out okay.
