This song is about Nephi and his family traveling through the wilderness, told from the perspective of Nephi&#039;s wife. 

Nephi and his family were told by the Lord to get out of Jerusalem because it was prophesied that it would be destroyed. They had to leave everything that they knew; their comfort, their home, their friends and travel into the unknown. They had to put their trust in the Lord.

1 Nephi 17:13

Lyrics:

My feet are aching.  
My tears are falling to the ground.  
My children, they follow me,  
but where are they following me to?  
Falling down, upon the ground.  
I don't know when the sun will rise.  
I will give it some time!  

Trust in the Lord!  
Trust him with all,  
all of my heart.  
Why can't I start,  
start now to see, his promised land for me?  

Why is it hard,  
hard not to be,  
the person that I,  
that I'm supposed to be?  

When things are hard,  
He's the light in the dark.  
He lifts me higher.  
My heart is on fire.  
Though it is hard,  
I'll give him my heart  
and let him lead.  

I'll trust in the Lord!  
Trust him with all,  
all of my heart,  
all of my heart.  
I'm starting to see, the light he shines for me.

I'll trust in the Lord!  
Trust him with all,  
all of my heart.  
Now I can fin-  
finally see, his promised land for me.

Trust in the Lord.  
Trust him with all,  
all of your heart,  
then you will see, his promised land for me.
