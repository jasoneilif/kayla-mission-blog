Hello family and friends!

This week was a busy week!

On Monday, we had a great preparation day, but we were kind of tired of sitting in our apartment on our phones all day, so we decided to go out and invite people to church. We stopped by Wawa to get some gas since we were low and while we were there we were trying to decide where to go, but neither of us knew where to go. We decided to pray about it and we both felt like we needed to stay at Wawa, so we pulled into a nearby parking space. We got out of the car and ended up meeting a super nice woman named Connie who said she might want to come to church! We also invited a man named Victor to church. He speaks mostly Spanish, so I ended up being able to practice my Spanish and invite him to church! It was super cool! After that, we also met this guy who looked like he was having a rough day. He said he didn‚Äôt want to come to church and that he didn‚Äôt need help so we let him be. It was interesting though because another man named Matt came over and told us thank you for talking to that man because he was homeless and Matt had been helping him for a while. It was so amazing seeing someone love and serve like the Savior! Then we went to a path nearby our house and called Layvonne that night and taught her the restoration. She wanted us to come by to give her a Book of Mormon, but her week filled up fast and we weren‚Äôt able to stop by.

On Tuesday, we had district council which was really good! We talked a lot about how Jesus Christ should be the center of our teaching and that was really good! After district council, we had lunch with the Jawahirs! It was really fun! After lunch with them, we went to main street to invite people to church and it was super cool because we were able to meet Davoy. He recognized us and we were super confused because we didn‚Äôt recognize him! Apparently, he was at the Bible study we had been invited to by Jade a few weeks ago and he remembered us! He gave us his number and he gave us his friends number as well! We also met Rick who was interested in coming to church! We were planning on going to CVS to pick up something, but sadly once we got there we found out it had closed an hour ago. We walked back to the car and then we had a lesson with Oscar again and talked about prayer and his religious background. It was a really insightful lesson into how we could help him!

On Wednesday, we had a busy day! We served for Parks and Rec and this time I didn‚Äôt completely exhaust myself. It was really fun and we put some more mulch around trees! After that, we had weekly planning which was a little rough for no reason, and then we had a lesson with Joseph which just felt off. Luckily, me and Sister Oliver were able to say a prayer together and then we were back to normal! We then went to the Mosers for dinner and it was super fun! I had rice pudding which my first time eating it as far as I remember and it was really good! After dinner, Sister Moser showed us her song that she wrote and it was awesome! She also gave us some fun puzzles! After dinner, we had a church tour with Dynamite and Brother Sweetman! It was so cool and we were able to introduce him to everyone at the Book of Mormon club! He really liked the paintings and the building!

On Thursday bright and early, we had zone conference. It was really good and it was very focused on the Savior which was really appreciated! It also didn‚Äôt last as long as we thought it would and so we were able to go to the Christiana Mall to invite people to church! We met Asia, Carla, and Nestor and they are really cool! We also met this nice lady named Peggy who kept on telling us to let our hair down and be free and get a boyfriend and job haha. After that, we decided to go to CVS and invite people to church along the way before it closed. We ended up being in just the right time and place to meet Ange! She was visiting the United States from Africa and she was lost and didn‚Äôt have the cell signal to call anyone. We were able to help her call her sister and find the bus stop! It was such a cool miracle! It was also a cool miracle because even though we went far away from the CVS to help Ange, we were still able to make it to CVS before it closed! We were about to head back, but we ended up having an impromptu lesson with Ted over facetime that went really well! Then we headed back and went to the Hearne‚Äôs for dinner! It was really fun and we had sloppy joe casserole and it was so good!

On Friday, we called a lot of people and rescheduled times to talk with them. We were going to have a lesson with Samantha and her son at the park, but they had to get their car fixed and were stranded for the day. It ended up being for the best since there was a heat advisory. It has been super hot recently! We also went to the Overby‚Äôs and they were having a rough time so we were hopefully able to cheer them up! Later in the day, we invited some people to church and met this nice lady named Jenae. She gave us her number, but I accidentally missed a number when I texted her and so we had to come back for the last number. It was super embarrassing, but she was pretty cool with it. After that, we went to dinner with the Trejo‚Äôs and had a fun dinner with them! Their kids were super cute and I think I ‚Äúcaught on fire‚Äù at least 30 times during dinner from ‚Äúlaser beams‚Äù. Sister Trejo made pizza with peaches on it that was super good! I had never had peaches on pizza before!

On Saturday, almost all of our 10 lessons fell through, but we were able to meet with Gina and Diego and they are doing so well! They have been studying from the scriptures and getting so much out of their studies and its really cool to see that. I also met someone from Richland so that was cool! We had lunch with Jachin and it was really fun and the food was really good! I got fish tacos! We also had dinner with Sister Mosher at this pizza place and we had calzones! It went a little long, so we had to park on the side of a random street for our lesson with Peabo. It went really good and afterwards both me and Sister Oliver felt like we needed to knock on the random street we had ended up on. I really needed to use the restroom, but I decided I could hold it for 15 minutes. We were ringing a house when a man named David Abraham next door stepped out and was like ‚ÄúHey do I know you two from somewhere?‚Äù And we were like ‚ÄúWell we're missionaries for our church and we go around a lot of places so maybe? He was like ‚ÄúOh I was just joking I'm just joking!‚Äù Then he sat down on his front step was like ‚ÄúSo you're missionaries right? Come over here and talk to me. I've been through a rough time lately and I have a lot of rebuttals.‚Äù So we walked over and we started talking to him about the restoration and how God is his loving Heavenly Father and that's why He provided us a Savior and prophets since the beginning of time. He started to really intently listen and he even got emotional as we told him that he has a purpose on this earth! It was so cool! He asked if we had any material or literature he could read and Sister Oliver gave him her copy of the Book of Mormon. We have been on a shortage of supplies, so Sister Oliver sacrificed her Book of Mormon so David Abraham could read it! He was so grateful we stopped by and it was such a touching experience for me and Sister Oliver!

On Sunday, the talks at church were awesome! It was just what I needed! We also got to go into two of the children‚Äôs primary classes and share our missionary experiences and answer questions! It was really fun! We did a lot of phone calls for the rest of the day and we had a really cool lesson with Dynamite! It is so easy to talk about religion in a normal way with him! We talked about prophets and he really liked that! We had a fun time right before bed after 9pm playing a game. It was really fun!

On Monday, we had a special activity with all the missionaries in our zone at President and Sister Harding‚Äôs house! We ran/walked on this really pretty trail and saw a pretty, stinky water fountain! We also had breakfast with the Hardings and then we had a kickball activity! It was fun also on the drive there and back because Sister Goodman, one of the service missionaries in our congregation drove Sister Oliver, Sister Talley (another service missionary in our congregation), and I. It was a party! We stopped by Ritas on the way back and I got an oreo italian ice which was really good! It was like if oreos were fruit and they squeezed it and then froze it and mixed it and then added some chunks of oreo!

Anyways, I hope you all have been having a great week! Thank you for all of your love, support, and prayers! Have a great rest of your week!
