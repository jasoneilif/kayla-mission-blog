Happy Mother's Day!

This week has been pretty crazy! We were kind of all over the place. We had so many things to go to and we had so many cool changes to the mission that I never expected.

On Tuesday, we had a pretty good district council meeting. We also ended up having a spontaneous invite from the Sanchez family for dinner. It was really good because we hadn’t talked to them in a while. It was a really good meal and we tried cow tail for the first time and it was really good! It was super tender and fun to eat! After dinner we were expecting to go home, but instead we all randomly got in their van and had some ice cream at a cool ice cream place! It was really good ice cream!I I got cinnamon oatmeal cookie ice cream. I thought I was all oatmeal raisin cookied out from last week, but I guess I needed a little more haha. We had to get going so they drove us back. It was crazy because the road was blocked with a ton of police and fire department cars. When we were finally able to pass, we saw that a motorbike had been hit by a car. It was crazy. We got back to the Sanchez’s and we were able to have a nice heart to heart with them and they told us what had been going on. They could really use some prayers right now.


On Wednesday, we had zone conference bright and early. We had randomly gotten asked two days prior to sing in zone conference, so we sang Dear to the Heart of the Shepherd and it actually turned out really good! Sister Oliver is an amazing singer and it was so fun singing a duet! Also, we had Costco pizza at zone conference so that was a plus. The actual conference was crazy! They changed the whole way we do missionary work. At first I had some worries about it, but Sister Oliver had a cool thought about how missionary work is just loving, sharing, and inviting, so that made it so much easier to accept moving on to those who are ready. We are now doing a style of missionary work our mission has called the flow. Instead of trying to overcome objections people have about church or the gospel and trying to convince them, we simply move on. It takes so much pressure off of us as missionaries and promotes peace instead of contention. Now we bring it as an offering and if they don’t want it, we at least leave them with a smile. It also helps us reach out to more people and it is super energizing/. It used to be emotionally taxing, but now it is just physically taxing because now we are walking a lot more.We got to try this new way of missionary work after zone conference with Sister Harding and the Broomall sisters. It was so fun because I got to be companions with Sister Moore and Sister Foukimoana for a couple hours! After that, we went straight home and only got half an hour to personal study and another half an hour to study as companions. We then went to Bob and Cheryl’s house for a lesson and I was exhausted. It turned out good though! We talked about the gospel of Jesus Christ using a whiteboard. It was pretty cool! Also, Bob showed us his big book of fish from all the fishing trips he’s been on and it was so cool! After that, we went to the Guthe’s for a lesson and played a fun Book of Mormon scrabble game. Brother Guthe won! He had some pretty big words! We also learned a lot about random Book of Mormon characters we hadn’t heard of.

On Thursday, we planned out our week and then we went to the apartment complex near where our friend Riel lives and we tried out the things we had learned from zone conference. It was crazy because we ended up finding 10 people who said they wanted to come to church! It was crazy! There was one point when we were talking to three different people at the same time trying to text all of them the information. It was crazy! After that, we headed to Sister Foulk’s house for dinner. It was so fun! We had a really good roast dinner with Sister Foulk and Sister McClelland and we sang some songs from the children's songbook from church. After that, we hurried home to pack and get ready to go to Vineland for exchanges with our sister training leaders Sister Bull and Sister Hunsaker.

On Friday, we had such a fun time at exchanges! I was with Sister Hunsaker and Sister Oliver was with Sister Bull. We invited a lot of people at a park and fishing area to come to church and one person said they would come, so that was exciting! It was funny because Sister Hunsaker accidentally got too close to a family of geese and they started hissing at her. Luckily, she didn't get chased by them lol. We also invited a lady named Betty who worked at Chick-Fil-A to church unexpectedly while we were enjoying frosted lemonades! She is so sweet! I also made some pesto for dinner and that was good! We also recorded us singing the song Oceans during dinner! After dinner, we went back home.

On Saturday, we went to Kayosalami’s baptism and it was so good! Sister Oliver and I both gave talks and even though it was last minute, it turned out good! The rest of the day, I was really stressed about finishing another last minute talk for Sunday, so it was kind of a blur lol.

On Sunday, I gave my talk and I think it turned out ok. Also one of the people we invited named Eric Andre came to church and he brought two of his sisters Ruth and Rebecca. They are so sweet! Afterwards we were able to have a lesson with Rick and the three siblings and talk about the Plan of Salvation! It was such a miracle! Ruth had a lot of questions and they all seemed to accept what we told them and we were able to give them each a copy of the Book of Mormon!

This week was definitely full of miracles and I am excited to see what miracles are coming this week! I hope you each are also able to see miracles this week!
