Hello! I hope you have all been doing well this week and that you have been enjoying nice weather! The weather has been getting pretty warm here and it‚Äôs been nice. This week has been like a mountain range (I am trying something new instead of emotional rollercoasters lol). I said goodbye to my companion and friend Sister Oliver on Wednesday since she is being transferred to Newark, Delaware. I will miss her so much!

On a brighter note, I have a new companion Sister Spencer, and she‚Äôs awesome! She is from Canada and she is super cool and nice! I am excited to get to know her better! She came from the Morrisville area so it‚Äôs been fun talking about the area since that was my very first area I served in!

Anyways, Monday was honestly kind of a blur. Sister Oliver had to pack so that took a lot of our day and then we spent a lot of time at the church. We traveled back home and had a lesson with Alexa. Our phone was acting weird so we tried to switch the sim card. Turns out it wasn‚Äôt the sim card‚Äìit was the church wifi.

On Tuesday, we had our last district council all together as a district and we finally got the news for where everyone was going for transfers. It was the last full day Sister Oliver and I had together and it was also my one year mark which is crazy! I can‚Äôt believe how fast time has flown! Anyways, we decided that we would have a picnic for lunch at a pretty park area we had always wanted to go to. It was so fun, and we even saw a bunch of geese and a crane! We probably stepped on a bunch of geese poop though because it was all over! Anyways, we found 2 free libraries, so we decided to leave a Book of Mormon in each one. Then, we headed over to this really cool neighborhood called Sherwood Forest and it was all Robin Hood themed. We had always wanted to knock there, so that was cool! We stayed out a little longer than we had planned and then we ended up having dinner at the Sanchez‚Äôs. Sister Oliver said goodbye to them and we were about to leave when Brother Sanchez asked if we were coming over the next day, so I could introduce Sister Spencer to them. I said we had two lessons in the evening, so probably not, but somehow by the time I had left out the door, I had them in the schedule after our lessons. They are very persuasive lol. Anyways, we got home and Sister Oliver had to pack and it was so hard just sitting there watching her pack. I was not emotionally well, and couldn‚Äôt get to sleep until midnight because I was sad.

The next morning, Sister Oliver finished packing and before I knew it, she left with Sister Hunsaker and Sister Bull stayed with me while I waited for Sister Spencer to arrive. It was kind of an emotional day, so me and Sister Bull walked to the nearby swing set and that was needed, because I was not doing well. It is super cool because both Sister Bull and Sister Foukimoana will be in my district! Finally Sister Spencer arrived! She is super fun to be around and she is super cool! We had a crazy day lined up! First we went to Bob and Cheryl‚Äôs place and it was super fun! We talked about the Word of Wisdom with them and they seemed to enjoy it! Bob even offered to take us fishing sometime . I haven‚Äôt been fishing in a while! After the Barber‚Äôs we went to The Guthe‚Äôs for a lesson and we had a great time with them! We talked about the love, share, and invite video! After that, we went to the Sanchez‚Äôs like we had planned and they weren‚Äôt home! They texted us and said come to this random address. It was kind of chaotic because the sister training leaders last minute wanted us to fill out a report and kept on calling us and distracting me from being a good co-driver. We made a few wrong turns. Anyways, we finally made it there and were able to get the form filled out ok. The Sanchez‚Äôs took us to a pizza place and then we went back with them to their house and had dinner there! Then we got back home and had our zone call.

On Thursday, we also had a crazy day! We spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out all the details for Rick‚Äôs baptism and we had a lot of stuff to do. Finally we were able to figure everything out.. Luckily things went ok with that and I was able to calm myself and avoid having an emotional breakdown this time. Then we went to Sister Foulk‚Äôs house for dinner and had some really good cheeseburger pie. Sister McClelland was there too and we were able to share a fun video with them! After that, we went to a nearby neighborhood to do some stopbys and we were able to stop by this one person we had been meaning to stop by in a while! He later called us just to tell us it was a prank and he was not interested and didn‚Äôt want us to come by ever again! 

On Friday, we had a pretty good day! I went crazy with cleaning again and cleaned out the other ‚ÄúNarnia‚Äù closet that was filled with a lot of pillows, comforters, and sheets. I was so surprised by how many bedding sets there were! A lot of missionaries must have went home in Medford and left their bed supplies. There was a lot! I think there were at least 12 pillows! Later that day, we headed to the Vancour‚Äôs house for dinner! It was so fun hanging out with their family! Their 3 kids were showing us all of their skills! It was impressive! They were breakdancing, doing the splits, doing round offs, and other crazy gymnastic moves! Also, we had some really good salmon! It was also cool because on the way back from dinner, there was a whole bunch of lightning! 


On Saturday, we did a lot of stuff in the Mount Holly area. We helped our friend Micae‚Äôl move and a few members from the congregation came to help! She was so happy we came! It was crazy though because it got really hot all of a sudden! Anyways, we decided to stay in the Mount Holly area for the day and we ended up knocking on this one street! It was there that we met Tiana and Thatiana. Thatiana wasn‚Äôt too interested because she seemed like she only wanted the address and wasn‚Äôt really planning on coming, but we will find out next week if that‚Äôs true or not. We think that Tiana is interested though! We told her about church and she was excited! We told her about the Book of Mormon and she was excited! We set up a lesson in the future and said a prayer with her and she was so happy! She said she would bring her daughter to church with her! We didn‚Äôt see her at church this week, but she might come next week! She is so sweet! We also went to the Sanchez‚Äôs house to drop off something for Sister Sanchez‚Äôs birthday and we played a fun game with oragami frogs to teach Norma and Dominic about the Gospel of Jesus Christ.


On Sunday, we were so happy to see 8 of our friends come to church! Eric Andre (Ricky) and his sisters Ruth and Rebecca came to church as well as Rick, Dave, Dottie and John and Jason! We were so happy to see all of them there! It was also fun because we were able to go to Dottie and John‚Äôs house for Dottie‚Äôs birthday! We had a barbeque and some ice cream cake and it was so fun! It was awesome!

Today we just barely finished Rick‚Äôs interview for baptism and he is all set to go for Saturday! We are so excited! If you want to join for his baptism, it will be Saturday the 10th at 1:30pm EST. Here is the zoom link!
