Hello friends and family!

Itâ€™s been yet another crazy week!

On Monday, we had a little scare because I saw smoke in front of the window to the bedroom which looked like it was coming from downstairs in the basement. I was really worried and while we were trying to figure out what was going on, a siren sound started playing and we thought the house was on fire! It turns out that Sister Moore had somehow accidentally called 911 and the phone was making the sounds and the smoke was actually steam from the running drier on a cold dayðŸ˜… After we were done with our preparation time, we decided to drop off some cookies to Lisa who has been going through a lot recently. She is so cool and she has a cute little baby and a giant fluffy black cat named Meow Meow. It was so fun! Lisa is a member of our ward who is Naveahâ€™s mom. Neveah is a super sweet 11 year old who just got baptized this last year.

On Tuesday, we had a lot of things going on! We had our first district council and it was so fun! After our meeting we all had lunch together at Olive Garden which was really good, but the free refills of everything made us all stuffed to the brim and we had a member meal that night too! I kind of regretted that decision, but it was delicious! Right after lunch, we got in the car and had a lesson over the phone with our new friend Olivia! It was so nice meeting her and she wanted to have us come over to her house and teach her family. She hadnâ€™t been to church in a while, but now she wants to come back! After that, we headed over to where George lives and then contacted some people on the phone before our lesson with Samuel! It was such a good lesson and Samuel ended up praying about a baptism date! He will be baptized on March 18 and we are so excited! We talked about the gospel of Jesus Christ! I think it is so important to remember that what the Lord asks us to do is joyful and freeing! We talked about in district council how following the Lordâ€™s will and being obedient brings blessings and leads to more freedom, peace and joy. One particular thing we talked about with Samuel is that Repentance or being forgiven of our sins and changing for the better, is a joyful process! When we repent and access Christâ€™s atoning power in our lives, it is like we give our sins and burdens to the Lord with a desire to be better and humility and in return, He gives us forgiveness, peace, and added strength and ability to change in return. I know that we canâ€™t get through this life or find joy in the eternities without the Savior and I am forever grateful for His everlasting love and mercy which are extended to me and every single person who has or ever will live as we repent!

Anyways, after a great lesson with Samuel, we went to Georgeâ€™s door and dropped of a Book of Mormon and Bible! He was so happy to get them and we set up a time we could talk more! He is such a sweet old man! We are so excited to talk with him next week! After George, we stopped by some other people and left notes and then headed over to the Twisdales for dinner! Surprisingly, we were able to fit in the food somewhere and it was really good! Their kids are so cute and we heard some pretty crazy mission stories from Brother Twisdale! It was a pretty awesome day!

On Wednesday, we went to Sicklerville to stop by some of our friends and then we tried to have a lesson with the Cosme family, but they didnâ€™t answer. We stopped by some others in the rain, then went home. It was pouring by the time we made it to our lesson with Thatiana at the church! She is literally so sweet! We had a good lesson with her and her cute 4 year old daughter! After that, we sat in the car in the pouring rain at the church and waited for a lesson on the phone, but that never ended up happening. We did have a fun rainy day car talk!

On Thursday, we had a crazy day! We had a lesson with our friend Darrel for the first time at a diner with Sister Borden! It was so good! We talked about the plan of salvation and he thoroughly enjoyed it! He asked a lot of really good questions and Sister Borden had a lot of really cool comments! After Darrel, we ended up driving straight to Vineland to have exchanges with Sister Bull and Sister Giles! We had to drive for about an hour and we were already over our allotment for miles in the month on our car. It was so good seeing Sister Bull and Sister Giles! I caught up with them on what had happened and we had a fun music night where we just sung and played the ukulele together. It was so good! We had so much fun together and Sister Giles even made some frozen hot chocolate which was so good! I might even like it better than normal hot chocolate!

On Friday, it was so fun being companions with Sister Bull again for the day. It was kind of a weird deja vu moment because it felt totally normal to be companions again, but we had learned so much since we had been companions a few months ago. I noticed that we had both become so much better at explaining things clear and confidently as well as having better companion unity. It was so cool! We started off the day with playing tennis which was so fun! Sister Bull taught me how to serve overhand and it was a blast. After getting ready for the day, we headed to someoneâ€™s house for a lesson, but she said through her ring (as well as her door lol) that she wasnâ€™t home and she meant to call us to cancel, but spaced it. After that, we stopped by some people and ended up sharing a message with a lot of people and finding a few who were interested in hearing more! We met this one guy who was busy with his car, so he cut me off mid-sentence, but He said we could come back. We also met this other guy who had a cute dog named Peanuts. Next door to this guy lived a couple who almost seemed like they were going to fight over points of doctrine and tell us we were wrong, but they were actually really nice and we agreed to disagree. We said a prayer with them and they gave us some snacks for the road and one of their pamphlets. After that, we tried stopping by someone else and after they didnâ€™t answer, we were supposed to go home, but somehow me and Sister Bull ended up just walking right over to the next door and knocking on it. It was cool because we ended up meeting a really nice lady named Sunshine with her cute baby Elliot! She was so nice! After that, we headed home and ended up not having our appointment over the phone with someone because they said they would call back, but they never did. Later, we had a yummy pasta dinner that Sister Giles made and me and Sister Bull had more fun on the ukulele. After finishing up our exchange with the sister training leaders, we headed back home. It was so fun! I missed Sister Bull and Sister Giles so much!

Saturday was so crazy! We started off  the day with a lesson with our friend Diane at Dunkin Doughnuts! She is super cool! She wanted help writing a letter to her daughter and then asked us if we could teach her daughter, so we will have to see how that goes. She is out of our area, so it might not work out. Dianeâ€™s lesson went an hour over, so we completely missed lunchtime, but we were kind of emotionally drained after Diane, so we decided to go through the Wendyâ€™s drive through. We traveled to Nnekaâ€™s house and decided that in order to be sane enough to have a lesson we would need to take a break, so we ate while we watched some ducks at a nearby pond even though we were a little late. After our short 15 minute break, we had our lesson with Nneka! She is so sweet and she has such a strong testimony of God! She told us about how Godâ€™s hand was in her life and it was so cool hearing her stories! She had also read the first little bit of the Book of Mormon unprompted. One of her favorite pictures was of Joseph Smith and so we shared the restoration with her and she loved it! That lesson went over an hour too, so we barely made it on our phone call lesson with Marvin. It was really good and Brother Chamberlain was on it and had some good thoughts! Luckily, Marvinâ€™s lesson ended on time so, we drove back and took a mini mental break at the house for 15 minutes. Then we headed to dinner at Sister Mesadoâ€™s house and had a lesson with her goddaughters Anajia and Abria. It was kind of hard to teach Anajia because she was super quiet and tired during the lesson, but near the end, she opened up and had fun with us. She did call me old since I had some silver hair lol. I guess a few silver hairs make me look 99 years old haha. After that, we went home and did as many of our other missionary activities as we could and then at 9:30 I was so exhausted that I just crashed in bed.

On Sunday, my batteries were a little more charged, but I was still a little exhausted. It was super cool because our friends Marvin and Nneka came to church today! It was nice finally meeting Marvin in person! We spent most of our time on Sunday trying to figure out the details for Marvinâ€™s baptism. That night we had dinner with the Wynneâ€™s. Itâ€™s crazy because I know their daughter because she works at the temple cleaning it. It was a cool connection! Also, they fed us lasagna and it was completely vegan! We had no idea! It was really good! I also tried some banana no cream (a vegan replacement for ice cream) and some vegan cookies with the texture of a muffin top which was really good.

Anyways, we have a lot planned for next week that we are super excited for! Hopefully we can plan for Marvinâ€™s baptism on time and do all the things we need to! I hope you all have a great week!
