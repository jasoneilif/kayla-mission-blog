Hello everyone!

The rest of Monday was awesome! We stopped by a few people and had a good time talking with some friends over the phone. Then we went over to the Sanchez‚Äôs for dinner and that was really fun! It was awesome being able to talk with them!

On Tuesday, we had district council like usual and that went pretty well! We didn‚Äôt end up finding anyone to teach when we went out to knock, and I was wondering why since I had felt like we needed to knock in the places we did. I was super confused and was praying about it when I had the thought that we need to take care of the friends we already have to teach before we will find anyone else. We had dinner scheduled with the Sanchez‚Äôs again, but we had wanted to stop by this ice cream place on the way to invite people to church, but we ended up not having enough time. I started to back Sister Spencer out of the parking lot, but I noticed that someone in front of us was trying to fix their wheels, so I let Sister Spencer know and we reparked the car and went over to ask them if they needed any help. They said no and so we turned to go back to the car and off in the distance we saw Dottie and John at this random ice cream place! It was so crazy! We went over and said hi to them and talked to them for a little bit! It was a miracle and a reminder that we really needed to focus on the friends we already have. After we talked to John and Dottie, we went to the Sanchez‚Äôs for dinner and it was so fun! We had some delicious chicken and rice and I had my very first pupusa! It was so good! It was also fun because Brother Sanchez‚Äôs parents were visiting and Brother Sanchez‚Äôs dad shared a cool object lesson with us since he works with seminary classes!

On Wednesday, we had a lot of lessons scheduled! We had a lesson with John and Dottie that went really well! I was able to sing ‚ÄúI am a Child of God‚Äù in spanish for them and they loved it! Dottie and John are awesome! We also had a lesson with Justin scheduled, but he didn‚Äôt answer the phone. Then we went home for dinner and then went to Bob and Cheryl‚Äôs house. It was a good lesson and we talked about missionary work with them! After that, we went to the Guthe‚Äôs for our usual lesson. I love going to the Guthe‚Äôs! Every time, it is so healing! I had been a little down earlier in the day and so it was so nice to go over to their house!

On Thursday, we planned out our week and then we went to Freedom Park to meet with our friend Wendy. She was there and said she couldn‚Äôt meet because she wasn‚Äôt feeling too good, but she proceeded to talk to us for about an hour before we split ways. It was kind of funny how that worked out. After that, we went to Rita‚Äôs while we did some things on the phone. I asked for a small ice cream cone and they gave me an ice cream cone as big as my face! It was crazy! After that, we went to Sister Foulk‚Äôs house for dinner and we had a really good taco casserole. It was fun because Sister Foulk shared the message with us this time and it was really good! After eating at Sister Foulk‚Äôs house, we went to a neighborhood to knock a litlle and we ended up meeting a nice guy named Julian who told us that a few sets of missionaries in the past had helped his dad and met with him before he passed away and how he really appreciated that! That was really cool seeing how some missionaries examples made a bigger difference in people‚Äôs lives than they probably thought. You never know who you might influence by being kind and a disciple of Jesus Christ. We knocked a little more, but I had go have an emergency bathroom stop, so we decided to go home. It was scary though because when we got home, we noticed that stuff had been moved around at our house and someone had been inside. We were really concerned and Sister Spencer went inside to check it out while I followed behind. We saw that the blinds had been fixed though and that there were packages on the table so we knew that Elder Lewis the housing coordinator had been there and not some random person. That kind of thing happened to the sister training leaders too where Elder Lewis came in their house unannounced and they thought someone had broken in haha.

By the end of Thursday and the beginning of Friday, it was so cool because the church changed the app missionaries use and put out a new Preach My Gospel (A guide for missionaries and members to be able to teach the gospel more effectively). I read the first chapter and loved it! It focuses a lot more on the covenants (or promises) we make at baptism and in the temple and it focusses a lot more on the Savior and His gospel. It also addressed a lot of concerns I had about doing missionary work and some things our mission had been doing. It was nice having that confirmation and some direction on how to proceed in a way that helps me focus more on the Savior and my purpose as a missionary. 

Later on Friday, we also got to knock on some doors. We were able to meet a super nice lady named Maddie! It started to thunderstorm though so we got in our car and headed to our appointment at Red Lion Diner with Dottie and John! That was so fun! We had some good food and conversation and then after dinner we went to their house for a lesson! It was a good lesson and it was so funny because while we were talking about what happens after we die, they started getting into a conversation about how they wanted to be sprinkled if they were cremated and where. It was kind of funny because one would be saying ‚ÄúI want to be sprinkled like this!‚Äù *demonstrates sprinkling like a chef decorating their masterpiece* and the other would be saying ‚ÄúYeah just like that!‚Äù *tries to repeat action of other but looks more like throwing bread crumbs to the birds*. It was such a random conversation!

On Saturday, we had a super duper long lesson with our friend Wendy over pizza and pizza analogies! Wendy is so spiritual and she loves and serves everyone around her! She is awesome! She has this analogy that at the end of the day she reviews her pizza or what she has done during the day and tries to make it better the next day. She thinks about what kind of toppings she wants and stuff like that. It‚Äôs super cute! We were also able to teach John Wyatt over the phone and that went really well!

On Sunday, church was awesome! Sadly not a lot of our friends came to church, but the talks were really good and John Booth came to church after a while and it was so good to see him there! Sister Spencer hadn‚Äôt even met him yet! We also had a really cool experience afterwards! We had an awesome dinner with the Bennetts and I had tofu for my very first time! It was awesome! We also played a banana scramble game which was super fun! After that, we decided to stop by Sister Corbo because we weren‚Äôt able to get in contact with her and neither was Sister Foulk. We stopped by and had a nice visit with Sister Corbo! We had to leave though to have a meeting, but we totally forgot to give Sister Corbo her papers that Sister Foulk wanted us to give her. Afterwards, we were about to wait to drop off the papers until next time, but I felt like we needed to go back to drop off the papers. We ended up meeting a really nice lady named Shelly in the elevator going up and after talking about chocolate, we invited her to church and she asked if we were Christian and we said yes! She then asked if we believed in the annointing of the Holy Spirit and we said we believed in baptism by water as well as fire or by the Holy Ghost. She was happy to hear that and told us she had a hard time finding a church because none of them believed in that and she had been praying for years to find a church! We were able to be an answer to her prayers! After that we were able to see some fireflies and Sister Spencer was able to catch one! It was so cool!

Anyways miracles are real! God places us where we need to be and he places people in our path! I hope you have a great week!
