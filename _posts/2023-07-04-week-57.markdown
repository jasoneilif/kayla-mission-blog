Hello everyone! I hope you had a great Canada Day and are having a great Independence Day! This week has been super rainy and have seen more thunderstorm alerts in the space of a week than I have seen in my entire life! It’s crazy! Also, the fireflies are out! It’s super fun! I can’t believe that a year ago I was in my first area in Morrisville trying to figure out how to even talk to people. I have definitely grown a lot!

On Monday, after getting my hair cut and finishing up our other errands, we finished street near Sister Foulk we hadn’t been able to get through. By the way, I love my new haircut! I haven’t had my hair this short in my entire life and its kind of fun! It feels pretty light and isn’t as poofy as I thought it would be! Anyways sorry for the long tangent haha. After knocking some and dropping off two Book of Mormons in some mini free libraries around the town, we headed home and had a lesson with John Wyatt. It was really good and things definitely seem to be back to normal which is a relief.

On Tuesday, we had district council like usual and it was pretty cool! We were able to receive some training on the new app we are using for our missionary work. There are a lot of really cool changes! After district council, we started to head back home and Sister Spencer randomly was like “Want to get Chick-Fil-A?” and I was like “Sure!” We went to the nearest Chick-Fil-A and ordered our food. It was so funny though because while I was waiting for my food, I looked at the workers and had to take a double take because Enya, one of our friends, was there! I was sooooo excited to see her because we hadn’t seen her since Sister Oliver was in Medford! It was crazy! I knew she worked there, but I didn’t realize how far away it was! It was definitely a miracle because we hadn’t been able to get in contact with her for a while! After that and our studies, we went knocking. We met some cool people and there was this guy named Daniel who spoke mostly Spanish. Sister Spencer was having a hard time pulling up the video in Spanish to invite him to church and there was a super loud lawn mower in the background, so I came over and showed him a pre-made intro I had saved from a while back. It was a miracle because I was able to also talk a little with him enough to get his number and name. Normally I can only talk in Spanish with people who don't know it and can't speak with someone who speaks it fluently, but I was able to talk with him and it was a huge miracle! By the end of our time knocking, it started to look like it would storm, so we just missed it. We went to Wendy’s house and got to talk with her a little bit and invite her over to the Reeves for dinner since Sister Reeves had been asking about it for a while. 

On Wednesday we got to serve at the thrift store again and that was really fun! After that, we went to Mount Holly to visit Cheryl in the hospital. She had hurt her foot and needed surgeries. She was so happy to see us! We were able to cheer her up and we shared a scripture and song with her. After visiting Cheryl, we went to a nearby street to knock on some doors. We were able to meet some really cool people! There was a lady named Robin who answered over her ring and was so excited to see us! It was so cool! After that we decided to get lunch on the road and we got some hoagies at Wawa for the hoagiefest. They were really good! Later that day, we also went to the Guthe’s house. It was a nice end to the day!

On Thursday, we had our normal weekly planning session. Later we had a lesson with John Wyatt which went pretty well and then we went to Sister Foulks for dinner which was awesome! Then we headed to Vineland for exchanges with Sister Bull and Sister Sessions.

On Friday at exchanges with the sister training leaders, we had a great time! It was so fun because that morning we decided to exercise by playing tennis. It was so fun! Surprisingly I didn’t do too bad considering I have never played tennis consistently before. We also listened to some fun music and had a dance party while we played tennis. It was so fun! After that, we got home and had eggs, spam, and hashbrowns which were yummy! We had a fun time the rest of the day too! Our lessons were canceled, but we were able to still do some cool things! I also had my counseling session which was really helpful! I learned a lot about communication and changing my thought patterns! Sadly at the end of the day our sister training leaders were going through our friends we were teaching and said that we needed to stop teaching John Wyatt since he hadn’t been to church for 3 weeks. I tried to tell them that he hadn’t come two of those times because we weren’t able to give him a ride, but they still thought we should stop teaching him because they thought he wasn’t progressing. I didn’t take that too well and was feeling sad and worried because I didn’t want to hurt John’s progression or deny him the blessings of baptism just because of other missionaries or because we couldn't get him a ride. Luckily, the ice cream truck came and we were all distracted for a little while from the situation. It was so funny because we missed it the first time, but it came back around and Sister Sessions literally ran out after it and chased it down until it stopped. We got some ice cream and had fun. Sadly when they brought up John again, I just broke down. It took a while for me to get back to normal again so we stayed another night. Sleepover! It was a miracle because for whatever reason I had brought extra clothes. I don’t normally do that! We sang some songs and had a lot of fun and it definitely lightened the mood and helped me calm down.

On Saturday, me and Sister Sessions did Elder Lindstrom’s workout of 100 pushups and 100 situps. It was super hard, but we did it! Then we made decorative pancakes and bacon! It was so fun! I made a pancake that said spam on it and a pancake that said beans on it! It was super funny! I was still unhappy about the situation with John, but I was able to mostly calm down and we were able to get back to our apartment. After a little bit, we headed to the Reeve’s house for lunch and Wendy was able to make it as well! It was so happy because Wendy and the Reeve’s got along so well! We also had delicious spaghetti! That was also a miracle because Wendy’s favorite food and the one she was apparently craving was spaghetti! After lunch at the Reeve’s we went to Dottie and John’s for a lesson! It went really well and we invited John to pray about baptism! He said he would! After our lesson, we went to the church to wait before we would go to the Sanchez’s and have a lesson with John Wyatt that we had set up a couple days ago. The Sanchez’s had to cancel and we had to cancel our lesson with John because it was hard to decide how we were going to tell him that we couldn’t keep teaching him even if he wanted us to. It was super hard and I just couldn’t deal with the pressure. Luckily I was able to calm down and use some of the skills I learned in counseling and I was able to talk to Sister Spencer about it and we came up with a way to move forward at the moment. We decided that during our dinner hour and in celebration of Canada Day and my 13 months and our ability to communicate positively, that we would get some ice cream at Evergreen. It was super fun and the ice cream was amazing! I had peanut butter caramel cookie dough ice cream and Sister Spencer had a banana split! It was super fun!

On Sunday, we had an amazing time! The service was amazing! I really enjoyed hearing everyone come up and share their testimonies and thoughts. It was so powerful! Also, our friend Wendy came and she sat next to Sister Reeve! I was so excited! After our testimony and sacrament meeting, we had an amazing lesson from Sister Richards! One part that really hit me hard was when she was talking about having faith in small things. It’s easy to have faith that there is a God or that Jesus Christ exists or that the commandments are from God. She was talking about how it really digs deep and becomes hard to have faith with the little things like having faith that a trial you have been going through will get a little better or that Jesus Christ can help you right now or that a question or doubt can be replaced with truth. It was really powerful and I realized that I need to exercise more faith in Jesus Christ and believe that even though I can’t see how things can get better today, that they can through Jesus Christ. It was also a super huge miracle on Sunday because the first time Wendy came, she was disappointed by how few people were at church and how we didn’t stand to sing and how she didn’t leave with a message, but it was so cool because more people showed up this time than I have ever seen, everything that was said was inspiring and powerful today, and we even stood to sing The Star Spangled Banner in church! Also, a lot of the things people shared aligned super well with Wendy’s interests and things she has talked about with us before.

On Monday, we had district council which was super weird. It totally felt like a Tuesday! After district council, we were going to go to this burger place. It was the whole reason we had district council in Vineland, but it turned out to be closed. We decided to go to Buffalo Wild Wings instead. Elder Roylance, our district leader, decided to buy the hottest wings for everyone to try, but they were Carolina Reaper wings! We all had a wing and it was so funny seeing everyone’s reactions. I think I’ve discovered on my mission that when I have extreme spice I drool, because I was producing unnatural amounts of saliva haha. Others were crying, sweating, and coughing, and some didn’t seem to react very much. It was definitely an experience! Later that day, we decided to go invite people to church in different parking lots and we ended up running into a lot of cool people! It was crazy because we actually ran into Monae who was the very first person we invited to church as part of this movement who showed interest. It was so cool being able to run into her! That was definitely a miracle!

Well I hope you had a great week! Happy Independence Day!!!
