Hello everyone! I hope you all had a great week!

This week was really good and things went well! Sadly I am already leaving Medford! I still have no idea where I am going and won’t find out until Tuesday. I am really going to miss everyone! Anyways, it was really cool this week! There were so many miracles and I am really excited to see what happens in the next coming weeks!

On Tuesday, Independence Day, it was super fun! We spent a lot of time with the other missionaries in our district! We walked up and down the streets of Collingswood and looked at all the shops and cool walls. We also spent some time at a national park playing tag football. It was really hot and I was super sweaty, but we had a lot of fun!

On Wednesday we served at St Vincent De Paul's Thrift Store and then we went to Dottie and John’s and had a great lesson with them! We also went to a diner with them, but we couldn't stay too long because we had dinner with Sister Foulk and Sister McClelland which was really weird because we normally have dinner with them on Thursdays. It was really good though and we had a fun time! I ate too much though and felt sick afterwards, but it was really good!

On Thursday, we planned out our week and it went really well! We were able to come up with some really cool plans and goals! We also did it outside at Rita’s which was so fun! We also had a lesson with Dave and Sister Sheridan which was good, but John wasn't really participating much. Later that day, we had dinner with the Vancours which was also weird because we normally have dinner on Fridays. It was really fun and we had Cafe Rio style food which was really good!

On Friday, we knocked in this really cool neighborhood and met a few people who were interested in coming to church! Then we took a bathroom and chicken nugget break at McDonalds before our zoom lesson with Derick. Sadly, Derick didn't join on the zoom, but we ended up meeting David outside of McDonalds. He was super interested in coming to church and it was a miracle because we were able to communicate with him even though he mostly speaks Spanish and a little English. Then we went back to the same neighborhood and found Brian who said he was interested in coming to church! Then we went to the Sanchez’s for a delicious spaghetti dinner and we were able to read the Book of Mormon with Norma! We did an activity where we drew out what we were reading and it was so fun! Norma loved it! It was like "Woo woo!"

On Saturday we had a crazy day! We decided to spend all day in Mount Holly and we ended up meeting at least 15 people who were interested in coming to church which is crazy! We normally only find 1-4 people who are interested in a day. It was super cool too because we ran into Kasim and reinvited him to come to church as well as his aunt Naeemah. Later, we went to stop by Niy who had sent in a request to meet with missionaries and we ended up meeting her roommate Rosa! She is so sweet and she has a cute little girl. We were able to teach her a little about the Book of Mormon which was awesome! We then found a few people nearby who wanted to come to church which was awesome! Then we decided to go stop by the Goins family in our congregation. They didn’t answer right away and while I was writing a note for them, a guy named Ross walked by that we invited to church and he said he might come. Not too long later, Sister Goins answered the door and we were able to get to know her a little! We started walking down the street and knocked on some doors, but once we got to this one door, Sister Spencer felt like we needed to leave. We started walking to a different street and it just felt wrong for both of us so we decided to get back to our car and head to a different place. After inviting a lot of people to come to church at around 5pm, there was a huge storm so we decided to go get some lunch from Walmart and then sit in the car in the Walmart parking lot while the storm passesd by. Eventually the storm passed and we invited people in the Walmart parking lot to church, It was there that we met Daibeliz! After Walmart, we decided to stop by a nearby neighborhood to knock and we ended up meeting a bunch of people who were interested. One of these people was Suzie. She really appreciated our visit and she said she would love to come to church. she had been going through a hard time and was really happy that we stopped by. We shared a scripture with her and said a prayer with her while she took out her garbage. She was so happy to hear that and we gave her a Book of Mormon. Sadly, her boyfriend isn’t supportive of her coming to church or meeting with us, so we are praying that her situation gets better and that she will be able to come to church and meet with us sometime.After going to that neighborhood, we stopped by Wendy’s house, but she was busy on the phone trying to figure out some issues with a pond that had been poisoned and had dead fish, so she told us to come back the next day. Later that night, we found out that I was leaving. At this point I was kind of expecting it because most companions I have had, have only been my companion for 1 transfer cycle or 6 weeks. I am still sad though!

On Sunday, I had to say goodbye to everyone and that was so hard. Dottie was crying and I was so sad to see her so sad. It was happy though because Daibeliz came to church with her two boys and she seemed to have really enjoyed it because she said she is coming back next Sunday! The service was really good! I got to share my testimony with everyone and I was definitely crying. Then the Atwoods give really good talks. I also got pulled last minute in the choir so that was super fun! I haven’t sung in choir for at least a year! We sang the Star Spangled Banner! After church, I said my last goodbyes and then we left home for personal study. After that, we went to the Richards for dinner and that was super fun! We had yummy cobbler and roast! We talked about our crazy missionary stories! It was a reminder that the Lord protects His missionaries as long as we follow the promptings of the spirit and try our best to be safe and obedient. There have definitely been times on my mission I have felt protected! After dinner, we had a lesson with Jason over zoom! It was cool because he was able to recognize the spirit and pray for the first time! He is progressing towards baptism so well! After that, we had a really good missionary coordination meeting with Sister Bennett and then we had a really cool accountability call with our mission! The governor of Utah and his wife, the Cox's, joined our meeting and talked with us! It was really cool! He looks a lot like President Harding!

Today Sister Spencer made me putine which is a canadian dish with fries, cheese curds, and gravy all mixed together. It was super good! We also went to Rita's. I should have known it would be a bad idea, but I got Ocean Spray Italian ice. It was basically frozen blue dye and sparkles that tasted like fruit snacks. My teeth turned super blue! Haha!

Next time I write, I will have a new companion and be in a different area! Hopefully it goes well! I am super excited to see where I go! I hope you all have a great week!
