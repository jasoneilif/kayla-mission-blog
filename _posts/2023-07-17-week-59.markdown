Hello everyone!

This week has been crazy and so full of miracles and blessings! It’s like the Mario game where there is all this fruit falling from the sky and you have to catch it. I feel like Heavenly Father was just throwing down buckets of blessings down this week and it was amazing!

On Monday, I spent most of the day packing and then we had dinner with the Sanchez family one last time before I said goodbye. It was so hard to go! I will miss them a lot!

On Tuesday after district council, I finally found out where I was going. I was so nervous looking at the transfer board! When I saw that I was with Sister Oliver in Newark, I literally started crying tears of joy and felt like running a few laps around the church building screaming in delight. I was so excited to be with Sister Oliver again! Sister Spencer also found out that she was going to be with Sister Bull which was also crazy! It was definitely happy transfer news! Later that day, we went to lunch with Wendy at a wing place and she gave me some meaningful departing gifts and Sister Spencer something too. It was so cool and we were able to tell Wendy about the temple and she thought that was so interesting! After saying goodbye to Wendy, we went to John and Dottie’s and said goodbye. Dottie was going through it at the moment, but we were able to cheer her up and that was awesome! After that, we went to this really good sushi restaurant with the Vancours! I got this roll called the shaggy dog and that was really good! I also taught Elaina, Tillie and Bubba how to make origami butterflies which was so fun! It was so sad though because I had to say goodbye to them. Elaina and Tillie wouldn’t let go and gave me the biggest hugs ever before we went our separate ways. That was really hard.

On Wednesday, I said goodbye to Sister Spencer which was really sad. I will miss her and her funny jokes! I was super nervouscited on the drive to Newark. It totally felt like either DeJaVu or a fever dream when I saw Sister Oliver! It was so fun seeing her again and we were just hugging, laughing, and crying! I had missed her so much! We decided to take some pictures like the ones we had taken our first day as companions two transfers ago. It was so funny how similar they were! I spent some time moving in and getting all my things in order. Sadly, the elders had packed the car while I was in the bathroom and they missed one of my boxes with toiletries so I had to wear glasses all week and use apartment shampoo and conditioner. After moving some of my stuff in, we got together with some people from the ward and helped our friend Jean move in to her new house. She really appreciated the help and it went super fast! We followed up with her after and she said she is kind of all over the place and has another truck load coming in soon! Later that day, we had a fun time with the youth and we were able to talk about why we keep the commandments and how to answer our own questions and stay strong in the gospel. It was really fun!

On Thursday morning, we had a great lesson with Gina Campbell and Diego over zoom! It was so cool because they are such a cute family! They are trying to get back into the swing of things at church and they are just doing so well! After that, we planned out our week and Sister Oliver told me all about our friends. After planning out our week, we had a really long meeting with our mission and then we went to the Overby's and had a great lesson with them! Later that day, we spent a lot of time at the Acme parking lot and a nearby neighborhood. We ended up meeting Didi near a garbage dump while she threw out her trash and invited her to church. She said she would be interested in coming to church! Then we also met Jade who is super cool! She is a missionary as well and helps plant churches all over the world. She invited us to come to a Bible study she and some other missionaries for her church were having. The Bible study was really good! We talked about Naaman and how living the gospel isn’t always convenient, but the blessings are worth it and how we shouldn’t try to pick and choose the parts of the gospel to live to make it more convenient. After that we started to talking to everyone and we ended up teaching Jade, Sydney, Aliah, and Harmoni about the Book of Mormon and it was a really cool conversation! Sadly, I got bit by a bunch of mosquitos and my arm was bit just enough that I looked buff from the swelling for the next couple of days and we also missed dinner, but it was totally worth it to talk to Jade and her friends. It was so cool! 

On Friday, we did some phone calls which was really cool because we were able to finally get in contact with Samantha and Mike after a while! Then we knocked on this one street and met a guy named Luis! He spoke Spanish so we sent his contact information to the Spanish elders! We had dinner with the Jawahirs at Red Lobster! We had a really cool conversation with them and the food was really good! After that, we called a bunch of people and were able to get in contact with Amanda, Fanny, and Nadia! We did our calls at this nearby trail and it was so pretty because there was water, geese, fireflies, and a sunset. It was so pretty! We even caught some fireflies which was so fun!

On Saturday, we had a great day! We were able to stop by Samantha's house with Sister Goodman and drop off some pictures of Jesus and a Plan of Salvation pamphlet. She really appreciated it and said she is doing much better! Then we went back home and did a lot of phone calls! Then we went to knock in a nearby street and we were able to meet Ellie and Joseph who were interested in church! Ellie said she might not come this week, but possibly next week! After that we rushed to Peabo's for a lesson and we were able to review the priesthood and the Gospel of Jesus Christ with him! Then we went to have a lesson with Caleb, someone who had put in an online request to meet with us and had been emailing us throughout the week. We had the Hadleys come with us, but sadly Caleb never answered the door even though we knocked both the front door and the side door. We also tried calling, texting and emailing him, but he still hasn't responded. After that, we decided to go home for a little bit and call a few more people. It was so cool because we were able to get in contact with some people! After that, we went to the nearby carnaval and after having dinner there, we invited some people to church! We were able to meet Anna who said she might be interested in coming to church on weeks when she isn't super busy with work! It was so fun at the carnival and the sky was beautiful! During our dinner break, we also decided to do a ring toss with Ducks and the person running it named Ray gave us a few rings for free to toss. It was funny because Sister Oliver almost hit another worker across the duck pond and it was so funny! I also had my very first funnel cake and it was so good! It was a little messy, but it was fun to eat!

On Sunday, we were at the church for at least 6 hours so that was crazy! The meetings were really good though! It was crazy because there were so few people in the young single adult congregation that they didn’t have any piano players and asked me to play. I could only play two of the songs though and we had to sing acapella, but it turned out really good! Peabo also shared his testimony and it was so sweet! We helped him get started on his family history after church and Peabo is super excited to go to the temple for his first time. After helping Peabo we got home at around 3pm and had lunch. Then we had personal study and it was so cool because I was studying about social media and how these technological tools are amazing ways we have to share the gospel. It was amazing and such a powerful study! I prayed to Heavenly Father crying asking for success finding someone on social media who was ready for the gospel. We hadn’t been able to find anyone in so long and I worried that I wasn’t doing something right. Not more than 10 seconds after ending my prayer, I looked at my notifications on my phone and saw a message request on Facebook for a guy named TC saying he desperately needed prayers and he wanted us to call him. We got his number and half an hour later we had a lesson with him during the all mission call since that was the only time he had available. His name is Ted and he is all the way from California. It was crazy because he said he had been looking for a church and the missionaries near him had been too pushy. He said he wanted to learn about prayer and the scriptures before going to church and connect with God and we were able to meet his needs and be an answer to his prayers. It was so amazing how God placed us in each other's paths so we could be an answer to each other’s prayers. It was one of the most spiritual lessons I have ever had in my entire mission and it was amazing seeing how Ted was able to feel the spirit. It was also cool because this entire week, Sister Oliver and I had been having really cool personal studies and companion studies about loving, teaching, and inviting others like the Savior and helping others recieve the spirit and this was a direct application of what we had been learning. It has definitely been a spiritual week! Heavenly Father has been helping us see His hand in our missionary work as well as our lives and it has been so cool being able to focus on our purpose and on the Savior more. It has made missionary work such a joy! I am so excited for next week and this next transfer! It will be so good!

Something we have been sharing with everyone this week is a little game, so I thought I would share it with all of you since it has impacted my life so much! First have you and whoever you play it with think of any random object. It can be anything from a tree to an elmo bubble maker and anything in between. Next, find how it connects to the Savior or the gospel of Jesus Christ. It’s amazing how everything connects to Him! In Alma 30:44 in the Book of Mormon, it says “Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.” I hope you all can find joy in doing this activity. God is real and He is involved in your daily lives because He is your Father in Heaven and He loves you. I love you all!
